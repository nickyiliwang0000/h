# JavaScript Superpowers: Spread, Rest and Destructuring

As we build increasingly complex JavaScript apps, we will run into situations where we deal with data sets of unpredictable size, or which require particularly lengthy code just to access the data. A few years ago, ES6 introduced some great tools we can use to cut down our workload and clean up our code.


## Spread operator

The _spread operator_ allows us to pass an array of arguments into a function as if we were doing it manually one-by-one. This is great because it saves time, plus it doesn't need to be rewritten every time the array changes.

Imagine you wanted to find the highest of the numbers in an array using `Math.max`:

```js
const numbers = [39, 25, 90, 123];
const max = Math.max(numbers);
console.log(max); // NaN
```

You can't! `Math.max` is a method which accepts a comma separated list of values, then returns the highest one. It doesn't know what to do when we pass it an array.

We could solve this by manually getting data out of our array:

```js
const numbers = [39, 25, 90, 123];
const max = Math.max(numbers[0], numbers[1], numbers[2], numbers[3]);
console.log(max); // 123
```

This is tedious, and if the array changes length, then we also need to update the argument list we're passing to `Math.max`.

Instead, we can use the spread operator. It is denoted by `...`, and it separates (spreads!) the items out of the array, so we can treat them as a list of individual values:

```js
const numbers = [39, 25, 90, 123];
const max = Math.max(...numbers);
console.log(max); // 123
```

The spread operator can pull apart all kinds of values:

```js
console.log(..."string");
// s t r i n g
```

```js
console.log(..."üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëß");
// üë© ‚Äç üë© ‚Äç üëß ‚Äç üëß
```

One thing we'll often find ourselves using the spread operator for going forward is to make new copies of arrays. If we try to simply save an array to a new variable, we run into a problem:

```js
const myArray = [68, 43, 5, 11];
const copiedArray = myArray;

myArray.push("a string");

console.log(myArray);
// [68, 43, 5, 11, "a string"]
console.log(copiedArray);
// [68, 43, 5, 11, "a string"]
```

Changing our original array also changes our copy! This is because unlike primitive values, when we store arrays (as well as regular objects and functions) in variables, the variable still refers to the original object in memory. This is a problem because we probably made a copy of the array so that we could treat each one differently (for example, change one and save the other).

A simple solution to this is to spread our array out, creating a new set of individual values, and then to wrap those values in square brackets (collecting them into a new array):

```js
const yourArray = [68, 43, 5, 11];
const aTotallyNewArray = [...yourArray];

yourArray.push("a string");

console.log(yourArray);
// [68, 43, 5, 11, "a string"]
console.log(aTotallyNewArray);
// [68, 43, 5, 11]
```

`aTotallyNewArray` is exactly that - totally new. It is stored in a new space in memory, so it isn't affected when we alter the original array.


## Rest Parameters

_Rest parameters_ are like spread's cousin. They look similar (both use the `...` syntax), but where spread pulls the items out of an array passed as an argument, rest does the reverse - it lets us tell a function to gather the first, second, third and all the **rest** of our parameters, and store them in a array.

Imagine you want a function that takes any number of arguments and returns them in an array so that we can use `.map()`, `.filter()` and other powerful array methods on them:

```js
// I want this function:
arrayIt(3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27);
// To result in an array like [3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27] 
```

You'd probably end up writing a function that looks like this:

```js
const arrayItToMe = function(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6) {
  const numbers = [param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6];
  console.log(numbers);
};

arrayItToMe(3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27);
// [3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27]
```

OK, this works, but what if somewhere else in our code we also want to call a function to return an array, but we only have 4 arguments to pass it? Or 10? We would have to write a whole new `arrayIt` function for each instance, which isn't clean or DRY.

Instead, we can make a single function that is more dynamic by using rest parameters. Adding the `...` before the name of a parameter, we can turn an array-like object of values (like a list of arguments) into an actual array!

```js
const arrayItRockapella = function(...numbers) {
  console.log(numbers);
};

arrayItRockapella(3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27);
// [3, 44, 81, 6, 19, 27]

arrayItRockapella("any values work", true, {worth: 100}, "awesome, right?");
// ["any values work", true, {worth: 100}, "awesome, right?"]
```

The spread operator and rest parameters look the same, but the difference between them is the difference between parameters and arguments. You use one to talk about the placeholders in a function (parameters/rest parameters) and you use one to talk about the actual values passed to a function (arguments/spread operator).


## Destructuring

Sometimes our problem isn't unpredictable data sets, but just overly complex structures that take a lot of typing to access over and over. _Destructuring_ is a quick way to grab properties from objects or arrays, and can significantly clean up our code and make our lives easier.

### Destructuring objects

Say we have an object that looks like this:

```javascript
const curry = {
  type: 'baingan bharta',
  side: 'naan',
  spiciness: ["mild", "medium", "hot", "extra hot"]
}
```

Now imagine we want to grab all the properties inside that object and store them in variables. In the past, we would have done this:

```javascript
const type = curry.type;
const side = curry.side;
const spiciness = curry.spiciness;
console.log(`My favorite order is a ${spiciness[1]} ${type} with some ${side}!`);
// My favorite order is a medium baingan bharta with some naan!
```

Instead of setting variables one-by-one, we can destructure our curry object like this:

```javascript
const { type, side, spiciness } = curry;

console.log(`My favorite order is a ${spiciness[1]} ${type} with some ${side}!`);
// My favorite order is a medium baingan bharta with some naan!

```

The curly brackets on the left might make you think that this is some kind of object, but don't be fooled! It's just our way of telling JavaScript to pluck the `type`, `side`, and `spiciness` variables out of the `curry` object and store them locally.

Remember, 'cause this might trip you up: When destructuring, the word on the **right hand** side of the assignment (in this case, `curry`) is the thing you want to destructure, and the words between the curly brackets on the **left hand** side (`type`, `side`, `spiciness`) are the properties you want to pull out of the object.

Writing fewer lines of code is nice, but when might you use this yourself? Well, if you remember back to your API projects, chances are you were getting a big object back from the REST API that looked maybe something like this:

```javascript
// Let's say the JSON Object that we get back from our API looks like this:

{
  'cities' : {
    'toronto': {
      country: 'canada',
      population: 1200,
      weather: 'temperate',
      food: 'poutine' 
    },
    'berlin': {
      country: 'germany',
      population: 1900,
      weather: 'temperate',
      food: 'donair'
    },
    'sydney': {
      country: 'australia',
      population: 1000,
      weather: 'warm',
      food: 'ramen'
    }
  }
}

// And we pass that object to our displayResults function

const displayResults = function(response) {

  const country = response.cities.berlin.country;
  const population = response.cities.berlin.population;
  const weather = response.cities.berlin.weather;
  const food = response.cities.berlin.food;

  console.log(`Berlin is a city of ${population} people in ${country}, where they like to eat ${food} in a ${weather} climate.`);  

}
```

Kind of long and annoying. Instead, with destructuring, we can do this:

```javascript
// again, our JSON object from the API

{
  'cities' : {
    'toronto': {
      country: 'canada',
      population: 1200,
      weather: 'temperate',
      food: 'poutine' 
    },
    'berlin': {
      country: 'germany',
      population: 1900,
      weather: 'temperate',
      food: 'donair'
    },
    'sydney': {
      country: 'australia',
      population: 1000,
      weather: 'warm',
      food: 'ramen'
    }
  }
}

// And our new displayResults function using destructuring
const displayResults = function(response) {

  const { food, country, weather, population } = response.cities.berlin;

  console.log(`Berlin is a city of ${population} people in ${country}, where they like to eat ${food} in a ${weather} climate.`); 

}
```

Pretty cool, right? If we we had an API call which **only** returned the information for Berlin, we could go **even more** abstract and do the destructuring inside the function parameters:

```javascript
// Here we made a **brand new** API call that gives us back only the entry for 'berlin'
{
  country:'germany',
  population:1900,
  weather:'temperate',
  food:'donair'
}

const displayResults = function({ food, population, weather, country }) {
  console.log(`Berlin is a city of ${population} people in ${country}, where they like to eat ${food} in a ${weather} climate.`); }
```

Woah!!

### Destructuring arrays

Destructuring can also be used on an array. Let's say we have an array of pizza toppings, like this:

```javascript
const toppings = ["pepperoni", "green pepper", "mushroom"];
```

We can destructure this array in the same way we destructured the previous object:

```javascript
const toppings = ["pepperoni", "green pepper", "mushroom"];

const [toppingOne, toppingTwo] = toppings;

console.log(toppingOne, toppingTwo);
// pepperoni, green pepper
```

Note that you don't have to grab every item out of the array, only as many as you want to use.

If you want to only grab, say, the third item in the array, you can add commas in to skip items in the array, like so:

```javascript
const toppings = ["pepperoni", "green pepper", "mushroom"];

const [,,toppingThree] = toppings;

console.log(toppingThree); // mushroom
```
