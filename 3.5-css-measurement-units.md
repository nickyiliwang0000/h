## Measuring in CSS

### Measurement Units
A large part of CSS is declaring what the size of something will be. It may be the width of a div, the amount of padding or the size of a font. There are a number of ways to declare sizes on the web - and no, there are no centimeters or inches on the web!

## Pixels

Pixels are probably the most popular way to size widths, heights and fonts on the web. It's the easiest method to understand because our monitors are measured in pixels. Font sizes from photoshop also line up exactly with pixel sizes.

```css
h3 {
	font-size: 20px;
}
```

```css
section {
	max-width: 1080px;
}
```

## Percentages

Another popular way to size up your fonts and elements is by using percentages of an element's parent. You can imagine how this works. A wrapper div with 100% width and two children - sidebar of 25% and the main content of 75%. This also works for fonts. If the parent has a font size of 20px, a 50% font size would be 10px. Percentages will be really helpful when we get into responsive design.

```css
aside {
	width: 25%;
}

main {
	width: 75%;
}
```

```css
div {
	font-size: 20px;
}

div p {
	font-size: 50%;
}
```

## Em

Scaling font size with Ems is almost identical to the percentage approach to scalable units. We set a base font size on the HTML and then all text on the page is adjusted according to that value.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

span {
	font-size: 1.2em; /* Produces 12px : 10px * 1.2 */
}
```

Ems can be used for more than typography as they produce an absolute value.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

header {
	width: 20em; /* Produces 200px : 10px * 20 */
}
```

The problem with using ems is that the value multiplies off of its parent, so any nested text will quickly get out of hand.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

p {
	font-size: 1.6em; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6 */
}

p span {
	font-size: 1.6em; /* Produces 25.6px : (10px * 1.6) * 1.6 */
}
```

## REM

Root ems are the solution to the problems that ems cause. With Rems we set a base size on the html, often a base of 10. Everything else on the page can be scaled based on this value. Need font size 20? Set the font size to 2rems. This method is great because if we ever want to change font sizes on the entire site, we just need to adjust the html.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

p {
	font-size: 1.6rem; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6 */
}

p span {
	font-size: 1.6rem; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6*/
}
```

## Measurement Keywords

Sometimes we will be able to supply keywords for sizes of elements and fonts. You will see the keywords **auto** and **inherit** most often. Auto allows an element to automatically size itself based on both its surroundings and content and inherit allows an element to inherit the style from its parent. We will talk about this more in future exercises.
