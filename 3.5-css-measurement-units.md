# Measuring in CSS

## Measurement units
A lot of CSS is declaring what the size of something will be (e.g. the explicit width of an element or its padding and margin). The web has measurement units specific to screens and browsers - no inches or centimetres here! 

### Pixels
Screens are measured in _pixels_, tiny units specific to digital images. Lots of web content, like images and fonts, are already sized in pixels, which makes them easy to work with on the web. 

```css
h3 {
	font-size: 20px;
}
section {
	max-width: 1080px;
}
```

### Percentages

Another popular way to size fonts and elements is _percentages_, which are indispensible in responsive design. An element whose width is a percentage will take up that percentage of its parent's width. 

```css
.wrapper{
	width:1000px;
}
aside {
	width: 25%;
	/* this will be 250px */
}

main {
	width: 75%;
	/* this will be 750px */
}
```
```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<main></main>
	<aside></aside>
</div>
```

Percentages are also commonly used for fonts. If the parent has a font size of 20px, a 50% font size would be 10px. 

```css
div {
	font-size: 20px;
}

div p {
	font-size: 50%;
	/* this will be 10px */
}
```

### Ems

`em` units are similar to percentages in that they take their size from a parent's explicitly declared size. They are commonly used to for fonts in this way:
```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

body {
	font-size: 1.6em; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6 */
}
```
The problem with using `em` units is that the size of a parent unit is variable ad we often need to nest elements, so the same `font-size` declaration will render different-sized fonts.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

body {
	font-size: 1.6em; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6 */
}

body main{
	font-size:1.6em; /* Produces 25.6px : 16px * 1.6 */
}
```
The solution to this problem is:

### REMs

_Root em units_ (`rem`) are the solution to the problems that `em` units can cause. With `rem`, we set a base size on a root element (usually `html`). Then, any sizing that uses `rem` will treat the `font-size` of the HTML as the basis from which to multiply. Developers often set the root font-sie to 10px because it makes the math easy.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}

body {
	font-size: 1.6rem; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6 */
}

body main {
	font-size: 1.6rem; /* Produces 16px : 10px * 1.6*/
}
```

The idea behind sizing fonts in percentage, `em`, or `rem` is that when you want larger font all over the website (e.g. at a small screen size), you only have to bump up the base font size and the rest of the fonts will scale accordingly.

## Measurement keywords

Sometimes we will be able to supply keywords for sizes of elements and fonts. You will see the keywords `auto` and `inherit` most often.
* `auto` allows an element to automatically size itself based on its surroundings and content.
* `inherit` allows an element to inherit the style from its parent. We will talk about this more in future exercises.
