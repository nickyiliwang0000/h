Bind, Call, and Apply

Now we're going to learn about three built-in JavaScript functions that will become important as we dig deeper into advanced JavaScript and especially React: `call`, `apply`, and `bind`!

## Call
Let's say you have some code that looks like this:

```javascript
  const person = {
    firstName: 'Evan'
  }

  const sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.firstName);
  }

  sayName(); // will log out undefined!
```

This is because in JavaScript, the value of `this` is determined when *calling* the function, not when defining it. In this case, `sayName` is called in the context of the global scope, so the function is looking for a property called `firstName` on the window (remember that in the browser, the global scope is the window itself). Since it can't find this `firstName` property on the window, it returns `undefined`.

What can we do about this? Thankfully, JavaScript has a built in method named `call` that allows us to attach functions to a specific object.

```javascript
  const person = {
    firstName: "Evan"
  }

  const sayName = function() {
    console.log(this.firstName);
  }

  sayName.call(person); // Evan
```

By using the `call` method, we are able to call the `sayName` function in the context of the `person` object, so that the `this` value will refer to the `person` object and print out `Evan`.

Now let's say we had a `greet` function that allows us to provide a name for our person to greet.

This code might look something like this:
```javascript
  const person = {
    firstName: "Evan"
  }

  const greet = function(friend) {
      console.log(`Hello ${friend}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
  }

  greet('Amanda'); // Hello Amanda, my name is
```

Why don't we see Evan's name appear here? Remember that the `this` value is always determined by the context in which the function is *called*, not where it is defined.

So what's the context of `greet('Amanda')` in this case? The window! And since the window doesn't have a `firstName` property, we just get an empty space at the end of the sentence.

Based on what we learned about `call` before, we can fix this by calling greet in the context of our person object like so:

```javascript
  greet.call(person);
```

But where do we put the name of the person we want to greet? Well, the call method accepts a second (and third, and fourth, and fifth...) argument which can be any value that you wish to pass your `greet` function, like so:

```javascript
  greet.call(person, 'Amanda');
  // Hello Amanda, my name is Evan
```

If we had another function that accepted multiple arguments, we need to comma separate them like so:

```javascript
  const person = {
    firstName: "Evan"
  }

  const greetThreeFriends = function(friendOne, friendTwo, friendThree) {
    console.log(`Hello ${friendOne}, ${friendTwo}, and ${friendThree}, it's me, your good friend ${this.firstName}!`);
  }

  greetThreeFriends.call(person, 'Amanda', 'Alex', 'Guy Fieri');

  // Hello Amanda, Alex, and Guy Fieri, it's me, your good friend Evan!

```

## Apply

`apply()` works virtually the same way as `call()`, except that `apply()` can take an *array of arguments* (instead of a comma separated list) as it's second argument. So, from the example before:

```javascript
greetThreeFriends.call(person, 'Amanda', 'Alex', 'Guy Fieri');

// becomes

greetThreeFriends.apply(person, ['Amanda', 'Alex', 'Guy Fieri']);
```

Why do we need both? Great question. Sometimes you don't know how many pieces of data you're going to need to manage (think back to your API projects â€” sometimes you get one piece of data back, sometimes you get a bunch).

`call` wouldn't work for you there because you wouldn't know how many pieces of data you're going to want to pass into the function. But `apply` is super useful because you just pass an array, which could have one or a million arguments inside of it!

# Bind

`bind` is  similar to both `call` and `apply`, but it actually **stores the function with the context that you provide to it.**

For example, if we look at our `greet` function from before:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "Evan"
}

const greet = function(friend) {
  console.log(`Hello ${friend}, my name is ${this.firstName}`);
}
```
We can use the `bind` method to attach `greet` to `person` and then call it whenever we like!

```javascript
  const boundGreeting = greet.bind(person);

  boundGreeting('Alex');   // Hello Alex, my name is Evan
  boundGreeting('Samar') // Hello Samar, my name is Evan
```

You might be of unsure when you will need to use these methods, especially `bind`, but you will see where they become incredibly useful once we get to React!
