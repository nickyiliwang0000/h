## HTML Elements

### HTML: The makeup of markup

Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language that we use to create web pages. When we open an HTML file within a browser, the code is interpreted as a visual (or audible) web page.

Think of HTML as the structure of a building. It is the framework that contains our content and defines how the content flow will be presented. It gives us a way to create semantic structure for components of our webpage.

Using HTML, we can define how our content is to be interpreted and consumed. When we write a text document, we might organize our content using headers, paragraphs, quotes, and lists. In HTML, we do the same. However, while we might bold or underline a header in a regular document, this is not done in HTML. That's what CSS is for. If you remember nothing else, remember that **HTML should only be used to show the structure and content of a webpage**. 

### Creating a new webpage

All web pages include a standard base structure. This structure will be different based on the project and age of the web page.

The current standard page structure is below:

#### Base Structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
	<title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

You can view this in your browser or code editor by viewing <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/hello-world.html" class="exercise" download>hello-world.html</a>.

The base structure of a webpage is something that you will not be expected to type by hand, but it's important to become familiar with it and understand what each portion of the code does.

This structure should be included on every web page.

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`
	* The `doctype` tag defines the version of HTML we are using to create our webpage. In the past, this was a long tag with many keywords passed in, but with the advent of HTML5, we can use this shortened version.
* `<html></html>`
	* The `html` element is the master containing element of our web pages. We write all HTML elements and content within.
* `<head></head>`
	* The `head` element is where we provide information about the web page to the browser. No content that is meant to appear on the page actually goes in the head.
* `<title></title>`
	* The `title` element is used to define a title that will appear in the browser tab.
* `<body></body>`
	* All content that will appear in the browser is written within the body element. Typographical content and structural elements go within.

#### Nesting Tips
When you are nesting tags within each other, you must __always__ close them in the reverse order that you opened them. Failing to do so will cause your HTML be to __invalid__ and your page will break.

In this example, even though we close the `</div>` and `</strong>` tags, we do it in the wrong order. Because the `<div>` was the __first__ element to be opened, it needs to be the __last__ closed.

**Wrong:**
```html
<div><h1>Welcome,</h1><p>Today is <strong>September 1st</p></div></strong>
```

**Right:**
```html
<div><h1>Welcome,</h1><p>Today is <strong>September 1st</strong></p></div>
```
HTML comments out anything between `<!--` and `-->`

```html
<!-- This is a basic comment -->
<!-- <p>This is some <strong>HTML</strong> commented out -->
<!--
	This is a
	muli line
	comment
-->
```
Another useful way to use comments is to mark what closing divs belong to. This if very helpful when your page is hundreds of lines long.

```html
<header class="main-header">
	<div class="wrapper">
		<nav class="main-nav"></nav>
	</div><!-- /.wrapper -->
</header><!-- /.main-header -->

```

Or marking where content starts and stops:

```html
<!-- Header Code STARTS -->
	My HTML Code...
<!-- Header Code ENDS -->
```
