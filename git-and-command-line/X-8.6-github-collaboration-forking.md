When working in teams or on open source projects, you will often use GitHub to collaborate. To make your own contributions to someone else's code, it's common practice to make a *fork* (your own copy), make your changes, then ask for your changes to be approved and incorporated into their *master* branch.

Forking is useful when working on a team. The master files are stored in a team repo, and team members have their own copies of the project so they don't step on each others' toes when coding.

### Forking a repo

To fork a repo, visit its GitHub page and click the Fork button. This will create a copy of the repo under your account on GitHub.

Now visit your own GitHub page, click on the Repositories tab, and you'll see you have your own copy! 

### Cloning your fork locally

To work on your forked copy, you'll need to get it on your local machine.  That's where cloning comes in. Cloning is the process of copying a repo from GitHub and downloading it to your computer. 

1. From your forked copy on GitHub.com, find and copy the SSH clone URL

2. From the command line, navigate to where you'd like to keep the project files.
3. Type `git clone COPIED.URL.FROM.STEP1 ` to make a local copy
	Note: If you've already got a directory on your computer you want to clone these files into, navigate inside that folder and add a space and a `.` to the end of the command: `git clone COPIED.URL.FROM.STEP1 . `.
### Pulling updates from the original source
We want to set up your clone to be able to stay up to date with the original repo. We call the original the `upstream` copy and tell your local copy where to find it.

1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository from above (i.e. `cd name-of-project`)
2. Find the original repo on GitHub.com and get the SSH clone URL (It shouldn't contain your username! If it does, you're looking at the wrong copy.)
3. Run `git remote add upstream COPIED.URL.FROM.STEP2` to tell your local copy where the original is located.
4. To grab any new updates from the original copy, run `git pull upstream master`. You'll want to do this periodically to keep up to date with the original.

### Making your own changes

Work on your own copy, and use the new workflow we learned above - make changes, add files to a staging area, commit and push. They'll only affect your forked copy so far.

### Asking for your changes to be incorporated

If you want the original owner to incorporate your changes, you can 
ask with something called a `pull request`. To open a new pull request:

1. Head back to your forked repository page on GitHub.com
2. Click the green Compare and Review button.

3. On the next page, click "Create Pull Request."

4. Add a useful title (and optionally, a description) describing your changes and click "Send pull request."

6. You're done! It's now up to the original owner to approve your changes. 


### Exercise
Our course notes are stored in a GitHub repository! https://github.com/HackerYou/web_dev_full_time 

Visit the repo and create your own fork and local clone of the notes.  Set up the upstream branch so you can check for updates on the fly. From now on, you'll be getting the notes here instead of having them emailed to you.

**Bonus:** Make a helpful edit or fix a typo in the course notes and submit a pull request for your fix!
