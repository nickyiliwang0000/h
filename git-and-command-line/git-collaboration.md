# Git Collaboration

So far we've learnt about git branching as a way for us to make copies of the project and making changes without messing with the original version of the project. We can then utilize git merge to add and merge our changes into the main version. 

The git branch and git merge workflow is a popular way for multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. However it's a workflow that is not truly collaborative. A basic git branch and git merge worflow means any developer on the project can merge their work into the orignal branch at any time, without a review process. This often results in mistakes and other developers being blindsided by what's been pushed into the main codebase. 

_Pull requests_ workflow can help us solve that problem. 


## Pull requests

A pull request (also referred to as _PR_ ) is a way of telling your co-workers or peers that you have finished a portion of the site, and that you would like a review of your code. This is not only an opportunity for you to receive feedback on your code, but also an opportunity to start writing more descriptive comments about certain functionality that other developers will need to understand. It's also important to include a description of the work included in the pull request.

A good code-review will contain feedback no matter the quality of pull request. If there are no changes to be made, write a comment that reflects that so your fellow developer can know they did a great job! However, if there are areas that need improving - you can add a comment to the specific line number under the Files Changed tab.

You can also change the settings on a project repo to _require_ a pull request to be approved by another developer before it is eligible for merging, which is a very common practice in a practical setting.

## Making a pull request

In your repository, create a new branch using the command line `git checkout -b [branch-name]`

Make some changes with your project. 

Go through the git workflow to push your changes:
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "[commit message]"`
- `git push origin [branch-name]`

After your branch has been pushed up to your GitHub repo, go to your GitHub repo page, and you should see a notification on your repo page: 

![a button allowing a user to create a pull request](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/create-PR.png)

Start creating a pull request by selecting "Compare & pull request". 
It will open up the pull request window. Here is where you can provide more information about this content change.

After you created a pull request, it is ready for another member on your team to review, comment and provide feedback. 

## Reviewing a pull request 

![create pull request UI](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/PR-review.png)

GitHub will automatically detect changes and differences that's been made with the pull request. You can review it by clicking on the commit.

You can comment on a particular line of code by hovering over the plus icon:

![pull request comment](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/PR-comment.png)


There are 3 actions you can make when reviewing a pull request: 
- **Approve**: This will notify the author that all changes are good, changes are approved to be merged back into original branch
- **Request Changes**: This will notify the author that some changes has to be addressed before continuing. 
- **Comment**: This will just provide general feedback to the author.

**A note on providing pull request feedback**

Just like giving any other feedback, try to keep your comments and feedback constructive but positive. Comments should be clear and descriptive. 

Bad Feedback üëé
- This code is wrong
- This won't work
- This is really messy

Good Feedback üëç
- Try using `position: relative;` here instead of `margin`, it is more suitable in this situation because [...]
- This class name is named in kebob-case, we should name it to camelCase to stay consistent with the rest of the site
- Great work!! (Always remember to recognize good work! With emojis!‚ú®) 

**When a pull request is approved**
If there are no merge conflicts, your code can be safely merged into your main branch. The GitHub UI will provide an option to merge the pull request. Your code will then be successfully merged into the original branch!

![create pull request UI](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/PR-approved.png)

It is generally recommended that you delete your branches, both remotely and locally, after they have been merged. An UI option will appear after you've merged. You can also delete a remote branch manually by clicking on the 'Branches' tab of your GitHub project repo and selecting the trash-can icon associated with your branch. On your CLI, you can type `git checkout -D branch-name` to delete your branch locally.

**When a change is requested**
You would have to address the change locally on your code editor and push up your updates to the branch with `add`, `commit` and `push`. You don't need to create a new pull request, GitHub will know that you've pushed some changes to the same pull request. The review process will be the same. The reviewer can then again either approve or request more changes to be made. This process will be repeated until it is approved!

## Merge conflicts

_Merge conflicts_ occur when competing changes are being made to the same file.

Merge conflicts are your friend! Imagine if there was no way of knowing that your code was about to cause problems for the rest of your site, and was simply accepted into your master branch only to have everything break. That would make collaborative projects a lot more difficult.

It is quite common to run into a merge conflict while creating a pull request. A merge conflict will prevent your branch from being eligible to merge, and will require just a few extra steps to make sure your code is compatible.

## Solving merge conflicts

To solve a merge conflict, you can follow these steps:

1. On your CLI, use `git checkout master` to go back to your master branch
1. Input `git pull origin master` to update your local version of master to the most up-to-date commit
1. Use `git checkout [your-working-branch]` to switch back to the secondary branch with the out-of-date code
1. Input `git merge master` to bring in the updates from your master branch, to your secondary branch
1. You should see a message that states:
"Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result"
   ![Automatic merge failed message on a command line interface](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/mergeConflictCLI.png)
1. Using VSCode open your conflicted file(s), you‚Äôll be prompted to either 
   - ‚ÄúAccept Current Changes‚Äù: Current changes are the changes to the code that you have made 
   or, 
   - ‚ÄúAccept Incoming Changes‚Äù: Incoming means incoming from master branch. 
   - Sometimes you have to click "Accept Both" and manually configure the code.
   ![a VScode message allowing the developer to accept incoming changes, accept current changes, accept both, or compare changes](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/acceptChanges.png)
1. After choosing the option that feels like the best fit, you‚Äôll need to `add` `commit` and `push`the updates on your secondary branch to your GitHub repo so your pull request can better reflect the current state of the master branch
1. Once everything looks good, on GitHub, click the "Merge pull request" button and confirm merge
1. On your CLI, switch back to master branch using `git checkout master`
1. Using `git pull origin master` your local master branch is now as up-to-date as possible
