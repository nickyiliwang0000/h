## Heading Elements

### Headings `<h1></h1>` to `<h6></h6>`

A webpage is made up of blocks of content. Each content section will have a header that denotes the content's place in the page hierarchy. 

Think of your HTML document as a research paper. You would probably have a heading at the top of the page with the paper's name on it. In an HTML document, this would be your h1: `<h1>Paper Title</h1>`

In the paper, you may have several high-level sections to divide the paper. These would be your h2 titles.

Under each of those sections, you will probably have a few more smaller sections (e.g. `<h3></h3>`) and so on through to `<h6>`.

Browsers will style the headings differently by default. When you're writing your tags, **choose the tag that makes the most sense semantically**, not the one that looks most like your design.

Correctly tagged headings like this:
```html
<h1>Title of my website</h1>
<h2>Subheading of my website</h2>
<h3>Title of a section</h3>
<h4>Title of a section in the sidebar</h4>
<h5>Title of a section in the footer</h5>
<h6>Subheading in the footer</h6>
```
Will render like this:
<h1>Title of my website</h1>
<h2>Subheading of my website</h2>
<h3>Title of a section</h3>
<h4>Title of a section in the sidebar</h4>
<h5>Title of a section in the footer</h5>
<h6>Subheading in the footer</h6>

Use CSS to override the default styling while keeping your page's hierarchy intact.

## Paragraph Tags

The paragraph tag is one of the most frequently used tags on the Internet because most of the content on the web is text. It's fairly easy to use: every time you have a full line break in your text, wrap that entire block of text in a `<p></p>` tag. Let's use the following block of text as an example:

>I’m super passionate about design, development, and business. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to do all three as a career.

>From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and PHP. I’ve been a WordPress developer for 5 years now and over the past year have been working a lot with HTML5, NodeJS, and many sprinkles of CSS3. New and open sources web technologies make me super excited and I can’t wait to see what's to come for the web in the next few years.

>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned. I speak at events on everything from HTML5 to UI/UX. I’m part of the amazing Ladies Learning Code where I instruct the WordPress courses.

You can see that there are three paragraphs in this block of text. In an HTML document, we'd mark it up like this:

```html
<p>I’m super passionate about design, development, and business. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to do all three as a career.</p>

<p>From a technical standpoint, I spend most of my time working with JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5 and PHP. I’ve been a WordPress developer for 5 years now and over the past year have been working a lot with HTML5, NodeJS, and many sprinkles of CSS3. New and open sources web technologies make me super excited and I can’t wait to see what's to come for the web in the next few years.</p>

<p>I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned. I speak at events on everything from HTML5 to UI/UX. I’m part of the amazing Ladies Learning Code where I instruct the WordPress courses.</p>
```

## Strong and Emphasis Tags

In the past, you may have used the `<b>` tag or the `<i>` tag to designate important content. Currently, using them is not a best practice.

Instead, `<strong></strong>` and `<em></em>` tags are used to wrap content that is important or should be emphasized. Default styling in the browser bolds and italicizes them respectively. These tags are used within higher level block text elements such as heading tags or `p` tags

#### Strong
Use a `<strong>` tag when you want the browser to know that the enclosed text is important.
```html
<p>Driving at night can be <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>
```
Which renders:
<p>Driving at night can be <strong>dangerous</strong>.</p>

#### Emphasis
Use an `<em>` tag to highlight or emphasize part of your content. 
```html
<p>We <em>had</em> to be there by 10<p>
 ```
renders:
<p>We <em>had</em> to be there by 10<p>

**Note**
The `i` and `bold` tags are not completely gone. Many have been re-purposed. Systems like [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) use the `<i>` tag to represent an icon.


## Span Tags

###  Spans
The span tag is a small yet mighty HTML tag. A span is an **inline element** which means that you can pop one right in the middle of a sentence and it won't give you a line break or any other unwanted effect. The span tag itself, like divs, has no semantic meaning.

Suppose we were writing a sentence about our favourite foods and wanted to add a background colour to each of the foods' names.

> My favourite foods are broccoli, goat roti, and eggs.

We would first wrap it in our paragraph tag:

```html
<p>My favourite foods are broccoli, goat roti, and eggs.</p>
```

Then we wrap each food in a span with the class of food. We use a class so we can target just these specific spans with a style. More on classes and styles later!

```html
<p>My favourite foods are <span class="food">broccoli</span>, <span class="food">goat roti</span> and <span class="food">eggs</span></p>
```

<p>My favourite foods are <span class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">broccoli</span>, <span class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">goat roti</span> and <span class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">eggs</span></p>

## img Tags

### `<img>` Embedded Image
The `<img>` tag is used to embed images on your webpage. It has two mandatory *attributes*:

* *src** this is the source of the image that is to appear
* *alt** this is the alternate text that describes the image to people who can't see images or search engine robots (who also can't see images... yet)

The image's source path can be **absolute** or **relative**.

An absolute image path is typically an image hosted elsewhere on the Internet. An example would be to use an image sourced via Google Image Search or from an image placeholder service like placecage.com.

A relative path is one that uses your document (probably an index.html file) as a starting point. This will be the path that leads out of your document, through folders or subfolders, to end up at the image file.

```html
<!-- using a url relative to the HTML page -->
<img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="My dog Hugo">

<!-- using an absolute url from another website -->
<img src="http://dogpictures.com/dog.jpg" alt="Someone else's dog">
```

<div class="accessibility">
<h4>Descriptive alt attributes</h4>
<p>It's important to include alternative text in the alt attribute for <em>all</em> image elements. We can make the experience for those using screen readers, or those with slow internet connections, waaaaaaay better by being descriptive. Instead of <code>alt="my cat"</code>, describe the picture as you would to someone who can't see it. <code>alt="My cat, Chloe, stretching in a ray of sunshine beside a window"</code>. Descriptive alt tags can make or break a user's experience.</a>

<h4>What if I don't think my image adds value?</h4>
<p>There <em>are</em> times when you don't need alt text. If the image doesn't add value or isn't useful to people using screen readers (maybe the picture is decorative or it's a graph whose values are discussed completely in the following text), include the alt attribute, but leave it empty, <code>img src="images/image.jpg" alt=""</code>. If you do not include a value for the alt attribute, screen readers know to skip describing the image. If you don't include an alt attribute, the image's file path will be read instead.</p>

<h4>Title vs Alt</h4>
<p>Another common question is "When should we be using title attributes?". Title attributes create a tooltip on hover. Title attributes are used <strong> with an image element</strong>, whereas the alt attribute shows <strong>instead of an img element</strong>. Use both and you'll never go wrong.</p> 

<h4>Words in Images</h4>
<p>It's better to use actual text instead of images with text in them. Screen readers can’t read the text in images, they can only read alt text on the <code>img</code> element. Also, when images with text are zoomed, they can lose readability and become pixelated. </p>
</div>

#### Place dogs and pug holders

One of the many fun parts of being a web developer is using funny images as placeholders. In many of our examples, we will use random images that we found online. Sometimes a design will require a specific size of the image; instead of finding a funny image and using Photoshop to resize it, we can make use of services that provide placeholder images.

Here are a few options:

* [http://placebeyonce.com/](http://placebeyonce.com/)
* [https://picsum.photos/](https://picsum.photos/)
* [http://placehold.it//](http://placehold.it/)
* [https://www.fillmurray.com/](https://www.fillmurray.com/)

For each of the above, instead of setting the image src to URL that ends in an file extension that designates an image (like `.png, .jpg, .png, .jpeg .gif`), we set it to one of the previous URLs with the last two numbers being the `width` and the `height`:

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/350/150">
```

<img src="https://picsum.photos/350/150">

```html
<img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/200/200">
```

<img src="http://www.fillmurray.com/200/200">

```html
<img src="http://baconmockup.com/400/200">
```

## Lists

There are two types of lists: **ordered lists** and **unordered lists**.

```html
<ol>
	<li>One</li>
	<li>Two</li>
	<li>Three</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Bread</li>
	<li>Eggs</li>
</ul>
```
The only direct children that ordered lists and unordered lists can have are list items, or ```<li></li> ```

Anything can be nested inside of list items, including inline elements, block elements, and inline-block elements.

There are three main CSS properties that we can use to style lists:
1. list-style-type
2. list-style-position
3. list-style-image

We can use the CSS shorthand for all these properties: list-style.

 <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style">Check out the details on MDN.</a>

Many elements on a website are semantically list but won't look like lists in the final design. However, lists have quite a bit of default styling attached to them in the browser.  To override the default styling of lists, make sure you remove the margin and the padding and set the list-style to none. 

```css
ul, li {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
	list-style: none;
}
```

## Link (Anchor) Tags

### `<a></a>` Anchor Tags
If you've ever made a website, chances are you've used an anchor tag.  Anchor tags (also called links, link tags, or anchor links) allow us to create a quick path to other web pages or to places within our site.

Links have an `href` attribute which tells the link where the user will go when the link is clicked. Here are a few examples:

```html
	<!-- Links to other sites -->
	<a href="http://google.com">Google.com</a>
	<a href="http://hackeryou.com">Visit the HackerYou site!</a>
	<!-- Links within our website -->
	<a href="about.html">Visit my about page</a>
	<!--linking a nested image to another page -->
	<a href="contact.html">
		<img src="images/contact.png" alt="">
	</a>
```


#### Creating a multipage site

All we need to do to create a multipage site is create more HTML files! We will have a main html file, usually called `index.html`, and another HTML file called `about.html`.

Within our index.html, we'll have a link to the about.html page. Like so:

```html
<a href="about.html">About</a>
```
#### Linking within a page
Have you ever seen a URL that that looks like this?:

```bash
http://mysite.com/about.html#food
```

When you visit it, it magically brings you to the food section of mysite.com! How does it *know*?

That octothorp (hashtag, hash symbol) designates an element's ID. Because IDs can only be used once per page, it is a perfect thing to target when we want to move somewhere in our current page.

Let's say we have an `h2` element in a document called **about.html**:

```html
<h2 id="food">Foods I Like</h2>
```

If we are currently inside of **about.html**, we can link to that part of the document by referencing the ID name like this:

```html
<a href="#food">See Foods I Like</a>
```

If we are on another page (say, contact.html) and want to link to that specific spot on the about.html page, we add that page to the href path:

```html
<a href="about.html#food">See Foods I Like on another page</a>
```

You can link to any element with an ID, such as a `<div>`, `<span>` or `<blockquote>` but you it'll be a heading.

Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/link-within.zip" class="exercise" download>**link-within.zip**</a> and create a navigation based on the available markup. It can be a single level navigation - no dropdowns required.

## HTML Attributes

### Attributes
So far we've explored how we use elements to define our content and structure. Before we move into understanding how to add more content and action to our websites, we need to talk about using attributes to provide information to our elements.

An attribute exists as a declaration within the opening tag of an element and provides a value through an equals sign.

```html
<div class="top"></div>
```

In the example above, there is a `div` element that has a `class` attribute. The value of the `class` attribute is `top`.

Different elements require different types of attributes. We already saw `href` and `alt`. Here are some other common ones you will be using:

#### Class

The class attribute can be applied to any element. We use CSS to select classes (and by extension, elements) and apply styles to them.

The value passed into the attribute is what is known as a class name and should be descriptive. Within a page, you can use a class name on as many elements as you would like. Keep in mind there are conventions for writing class names (more on this in our CSS lesson).

```html
<h2 class="titleText">Isn't HTML the best?</h2>

<div class="header">
    <h1>Welcome to HackerYou!</h1>
</div>
```

#### ID

Like the `class` attribute, the `id` attribute can be used to style an element. Unlike the `class` attribute, the `id` attribute can only be used once in a document; it's meant to identify a specific section of the page that can be linked to. 

The link below will bring you to the section of the page with an `id` attribute of 'Markup'.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Markup" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Markup</a>

#### title
The title attribute provides more information about an element when a user hovers over it. As mentioned earlier on this page, it is best used within an image element to provide information about the image to the user.

```html
<div title="I say Goodbye">
    <p>You say Hello</p>
</div>
```

<div title="I say Goodbye">
    <p>You say Hello</p>
</div>

#### src
The `src` attribute is used to pass in the source of an element. It is most commonly used on an image element:

```html
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="Small beige pug wearing a Santa hat">
```

#### href
The `href` attribute stands for *hypertext reference* and is used in anchor links.  The value of the `href` attribute is the path to where the link should take the user.

```html
<a href="http://hackeryou.com">HackerYou</a>
```

#### alt  
The alternate text that describes an image. Helpful for both search engines and visually impaired users. It is important to provide a meaningful description for your alt attribute. [Here is a great article that explains best practices for alt text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text).

```html
<img src="dog.jpg" alt="Small beige pug wearing a Santa hat">
```

**Many more** - We will run into many more attributes as we work with HTML.
`type=" "`,`value=" "`,`placeholder=" "`,`style=" "`*, `checked=" "`, `for=" "`, `name=" "`

**FUN FACT** : You may see some attributes from older versions of  HTML that you should **never** use.  They are presented here as apocryphal reference.
`width=" "`, `height=" "`, `align=" "`, `color=" "`, `size=" "`, `bgcolor=" "`, `font=" "`
As you may have guessed, these are all presentational. Any of these will work in the browser, but remember that when writing modern, semantic code **styling is never HTML's job**.
