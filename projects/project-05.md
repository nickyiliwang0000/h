# Project 5 (solo React application)

## Due date

Project due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Project scope due date

Friday, June 19th, 4 p.m.

## Project description

Using the React library we would like you to create an interactive application. This will call on everything you have learned up to now!

This application could be a:

-   Lookbook
-   Meme generator
-   Stock images finder (curated user stock images)
-   Make-up review app
-   Playlist generator
-   Address book
-   Voting app
-   Notes application
-   Bill splitter (roommates!)
-   Blog

Your data should come from an API or be stored in Firebase.

## Project objective

To show a understanding of React basic concepts (e.g. state, props, components) as well as error handling and UI design.

## Project proposals

Once you have a good idea, we want you to fill out a [scope outline document](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XgB1rZD3JnVAGylmlmpIolH6dLpbq6vNnfLZ1WmGGCc/edit) and then meet with **an instructor who will approve and submit it for you**. This is designed to make you think about what your minimum viable product is (i.e. what is the smallest version of this idea that is a functional product), and it mimics a project approval process you may do at work. Here is [an example of a scope approval](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/Scope%20Approval%20Example.pdf).

Remember that you can have as many stretch goals as you want, but the minimum viable product is what's stated on your scope document and you are **committed to producing** that by the deadline.

> **It is always better to under-promise and over-deliver.**

<!--- ### Deployment
(optional) In order to make deploying your app easy use the Firebase hosting features to get your site up online! There is the ability to add a custom domain if you would like, so think about a fun, shareable domain for your application . --->

If you have not gotten an instructor's approval on a scope document by Monday, April 27th, 6 p.m., **you will be assigned a project**.

## How will this project be graded?

**Requirements:**

-   Uses React, and no jQuery
-   Uses modular components
-   Uses axios and/or Firebase
-   React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs!)
-   this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
-   App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop-down menu, search field)
-   It is clear to the user what the app does
-   App and interactions are accessible
-   Errors are handled effectively
-   Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:

-   Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
-   Semantic HTML elements are used properly
-   All CSS for the site is written in only **one** CSS file (no inline styles, no separate CSS files for each component, etc). How you get there is up to you.
-   Setup snippet is used
-   Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
-   Site is responsive and uses media queries
-   Files and folders share a naming convention.

You will also be given marks for your project presentation:

-   Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
-   Student was able to identify a technical win
-   Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
-   Student did not go over time

## Peer Code Review

Part of your mark for this project will be from a Peer Code Review. You will be given a rubric and a review partner once the project has been handed in. You will take one hour in class time to sit together and deliver your feedback to each other. At the end of the hour you will be asked to grade your partner's review of your code. Both their review of your code and their evaluation of your review will be included in your mark for this project. 

### Why is code review important? 

[Here is a resource](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/resources-and-cheat-sheets/code-review-best-practices.md) to find out more about how code reviews in the professional world and why they are important to practice. 

### What should I look for in a good review? 

You are looking for an opportunity to imporve your code and be exposed to new ways of thinking. You should evaluate your partner's review of your code according to these three criteria:

Did they ...

1. Deliver a Clear and Thorough Review
2. Ask Open Ended Questions
3. Provide Positive and Constructive Criticism

You will be given a chance to make any further comments about their review as well (this feedback will be given to them directly and not filtered).

## Submitting your project

1. Remove any unneeded files from the project.
2. Create a repository with a descriptive name that matches your naming convention.
3. Push your files to GitHub (you should be doing this continuously, not just at the end!)
4. Deploy your website to GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or on your own domain/subdomain
5. Submit your repo URL and live link using [the project submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ld09hsgj2WEpCEjNwg8ezA-wOlsFKeuBleYHlOPDUW0/edit).

<!-- ## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces.

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of instructor and peer feedback on design during project work time. ðŸŽ¨ -->

## Lateness

Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!

Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
