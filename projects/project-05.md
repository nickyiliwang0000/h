# Project 5 (solo React application)
## Due date
Monday, March 4th, 1:00 p.m.

## Project description
Using the React library we would like you to create an interactive application.  This will call on everything you have learned up to now!

This application could be a:

* Lookbook 
* Meme generator
* TV/Movie guide
* Playlist generator  
* Address book
* Personal expense tracker
* Blog
* Voting app
* Notes application
* Stock images finder (curated user stock images)
* What's in my fridge
* Bill splitter (roommates!)

Your data should come from an API or be stored in Firebase.

### Some previous examples
* [Catbot](https://catbot-29276.firebaseapp.com/)
* [Filtergram](https://filtergram-62c8d.firebaseapp.com/)
* [Online Dating](http://onlinedating.esmecodes.com/)
* [Digital zine](http://www.ritasolo.com/digitalzine/)

## Project proposals
A key component of planning any web application is managing scope. We will again require a completed [scope outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xz9-80T2bHxZpqXOD_CfAHSlmesN_6_V0QAZwCbsMhI/edit?usp=sharing) before you begin any meaningful work on your project. Once you have an idea (before you fill out your scope document, even!), you will be required to pitch it to us. This pitch should include an outline of the functionality that your app will offer users, as well as some stretch features you plan to add if you have extra time.

Remember that you can have as many stretch goals as you want, but the minimum viable product is what's stated on your scope document and you are **committed to producing** that by the deadline. It is always better to under-promise and over-deliver.

<!--- ### Deployment
(optional) In order to make deploying your app easy use the Firebase hosting features to get your site up online! There is the ability to add a custom domain if you would like, so think about a fun, shareable domain for your application . --->

## How will this project be graded?
**Requirements:**
* Uses React, and no jQuery
* Uses modular components
* Uses Axios and/or Firebase
* React 'knows' about all DOM changes 
* this.state is never directly changed because .setState() is always used to alter state
* App is dynamic based on user interaction (eg. drop down menu, search field)
* It is clear to the user what the app does
* App and interactions are accessible
* Errors are handled effectively
* Site is live on Firebase Hosting or student's own URL

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Site is responsive and uses media queries
* Files and folders share a naming convention.

You will also be given marks for your project presentation:
* Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
* Student was able to identify a technical win
* Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
* Student did not go over time


## Submitting your project
You'll be submitting your project via GitHub and posting the link to the repository on Basecamp.

1. Remove any unneeded files from the project.
1. Create a repository with a descriptive name that matches your naming convention.
1. Push your files to GitHub (you should be doing this continuously, not just at the end!)
1. Deploy your website to GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or on your own domain/subdomain
1. Post the link to the repository AND the link to the live site on Basecamp.

## Lateness
Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
