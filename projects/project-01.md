# Project 1 (1 page PSD conversion)
## Due date
Wednesday, October 30th, 10:00 a.m. ðŸ‘»

## Project description
This project is meant to emulate a common task you will perform as a front-end developer. You will be provided a design and you will be tasked with building it. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for your users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

## Project objective
To show that you can take a PSD and convert it into a functional, responsive website.

## Working with a design
We're using an application called [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) to share designs with you. Zeplin provides an interactive view of your design that you can click around to extract assets and information about what you are building. It will also give you clues about measurements, font sizes, and colours.

Remember that you can discuss font sizes with the designer if you think they are too small to be read comfortably.

## How will this project be graded?

**Requirements:**
* Site is responsive and uses media queries
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* One external `.css` stylesheet is used for whole project
* Setup snippet is used
* All images considered content have descriptive alt text
* Floats and .clearfix are used properly
* Google web fonts are used
* Project represents the provided design well
* Files, folders, & naming conventions followed (kabob-case) (this includes your project repo)

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:
* Extraneous code is removed

You will also be given marks for your project presentation:
* Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
* Student was able to identify a technical win
* Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
* Student did not go over time

## Which design do I code?
Much like in the workplace, you don't get to choose the design you code - you'll be assigned! 

You can find your assignment [here](). Headings of the columns are links to the Zeplin files.

> Feel free to print a copy using the printer by the windows! You'll need a USB port on your computer. If you only have USB-C, there's usually an adaptor in the cabinet to the left of the printer.

## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces. 

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of the Bootcamp Designer. ðŸŽ¨

## Lateness
Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m. or 1 p.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
