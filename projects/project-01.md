# Project 1 (1 page PSD conversion)

## Due date

Project due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Project description

This project is meant to emulate a common task you will perform as a front-end developer. You will be provided a design and you will be tasked with building it. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for your users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

## Project objective

To show that you can take a PSD and convert it into a functional, responsive website.

## Working with a design

Take the time to fully understand the design. It will help you know how to approach your code, with lots of information about measurements, font sizes, and colours.

Remember that you can discuss font sizes with the designer if you think they are too small to be read comfortably.

While it isn't included in the design, please find somewhere in your project to add a "Created at Juno College" note with a link to [the Juno website](https://junocollege.com/). Your footer is the most likely place for this, but whatever you feel works best with your design.


## How will this project be graded?

## Which design do I code?

Much like in the workplace, you don't get to choose the design you code - you'll be assigned!

You can find your assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nNtc4s0M6aWJv1K_sNPYzFOXappNFq9LZYzwl4B9JQg/edit?usp=sharing). Headings of the columns are links to the zip files.

<!-- > Feel free to print a copy using the printer by the windows! You'll need a USB port on your computer. If you only have USB-C, there's usually an adaptor in the cabinet to the left of the printer. -->

<!-- ## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces.

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of instructor and peer feedback on design during project work time. ðŸŽ¨ -->

## Lateness

Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m. or 1 p.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!

Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
