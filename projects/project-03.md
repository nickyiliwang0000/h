# Project 3 (solo interactive jQuery site)

## Due date

Project due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Project description

This week you are going to write some JavaScript using the jQuery library in order to build an interactive site of your choosing. It could be:

-   an 'experience' (information displayed in an interactive way)
-   a gallery / slideshow
-   a quiz
-   a game

## Project objective

To show a understanding of jQuery, DOM manipulation, error handling, and UI design.

### Some previous examples

* [Metal Subgenre Quiz](https://christophercos.github.io/MetalSubgenreQuiz/)
* [Roller Derby Name Generator](http://nomderby.com/)
* [Design your workspace](https://kayevans.github.io/kayEvansStocksProjectThree/)

<!-- The following one is great but seems to be down: -->
<!-- -   [Doggy Doppelganger](http://www.doggydoppelganger.com/) (Editor's note: heartbreaking that they didn't go for... Dogppelganger.) -->

## Project proposals

Once you have a good idea, we want you to fill out a [scope outline document](https://forms.gle/B9cJMn8qmu7YEXBa7) and then meet with **an instructor who will approve and submit it for you**. This is designed to make you think about what your minimum viable product is (i.e. what is the smallest version of this idea that is a functional product), and it mimics a project approval process you may do at work. Here is [an example of a scope approval](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/Scope%20Approval%20Example.pdf).

Remember that you can have as many stretch goals as you want, but the minimum viable product is what's stated on your scope document and you are **committed to producing** that by the deadline.

> **It is always better to under-promise and over-deliver.**

## How will this project be graded?

**Requirements:**

* It is clear to the user what the app does
* Adds to the DOM dynamically using JavaScript
* Interacts with the DOM (HTML) using events or taking input from the user
* Modern ES6 variable declarations used (`let`, `const`)
* GitHub repo has more than one significant commit
* App and interactions are accessible
* Site is live on GH Pages or student's own URL
* Errors are handled effectively
* Sass is used
* Files, folders & naming conventions followed (camelCase) (this includes your project repo)

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:

* Site is built in jQuery, vanilla JS is used only where jQ isn't possible.
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* One external `.css` stylesheet is used for whole project
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

You will also be given a mark for presenting your project.

<!-- You will also be given marks for your project presentation:

-   Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
-   Student was able to identify a technical win
-   Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
-   Student did not go over time -->


## Peer Code Review

Part of your mark for this project will be from a Peer Code Review. You will be given a rubric and a review partner once the project has been handed in. You will take one hour in class time to sit together and deliver your feedback to each other. At the end of the hour you will be asked to grade your partner's review of your code. Both their review of your code and their evaluation of your review will be included in your mark for this project. 

### Why is code review important? 

[Here is a resource](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/resources-and-cheat-sheets/code-review-best-practices.md) to find out more about code reviews in the professional world and why they are important to practice. 

### What should I look for in a good review? 

You are looking for an opportunity to improve your code and be exposed to new ways of thinking. You should evaluate your partner's review of your code according to these three criteria:

Did they ...

1. Deliver a clear and thorough review
2. Ask open-ended questions
3. Provide positive and constructive criticism

You will be given a chance to make any further comments about their review as well - this feedback will be given to them directly and not filtered.

## Submitting your project

1. Remove any unneeded files from the project.
2. Create a repository with a name made up of your own first name, then your last name, and project three (e.g.`firstNameLastNameProjectThree`).
3. Push your files to GitHub (you should be doing this continuously, not just at the end!)
4. Deploy your website to GitHub Pages or on your own domain/subdomain
5. Submit your repo URL using [the project submission form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRr63HMZPrJDomUPKwtmYRsTXWP8pCPFdGEyE2cFst-7BFUQ/viewform).

<!-- ## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces.

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of instructor and peer feedback on design during project work time. ðŸŽ¨ -->

## Lateness

Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!

Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
