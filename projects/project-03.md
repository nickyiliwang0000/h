# Project 3 (solo interactive jQuery site)
## Due date
Monday, Nov 18, 10:00 a.m.

## Project description
This week you are going to write some JavaScript using the jQuery library in order to build an interactive site of your choosing. It could be:
* an 'experience' (information displayed in an interactive way)
* a gallery / slideshow
* a quiz
* a game

## Project objective
To show a understanding of jQuery, DOM manipulation, error handling, and UI design.

### Some previous examples
* [RyanIpsum](http://www.laurengreenway.com/ryanipsum/)
* [Metal Subgenre Quiz](https://christophercos.github.io/MetalSubgenreQuiz/)
* [Doggy Doppelganger](http://www.doggydoppelganger.com/) (Editor's note: heartbreaking that they didn't go for... Dogppelganger.)
* [Roller Derby Name Generator](http://nomderby.com/)
* [Shake It Up!](http://haleybowes.com/shake-it-up/)
* [Drake Soundboard](http://jenniferyeung.ca/drizzy/)

## Project proposals
Once you have a good idea, we want you to fill out a [scope outline document](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1t1l591AZadar30FyrURnNQU6XIJ-9bdm62mpJrKEQFk/edit) and then meet with **an instructor who will approve and submit it for you**. This is designed to make you think about what your minimum viable product is (i.e. what is the smallest version of this idea that is a functional product), and it mimics a project approval process you may do at work.

Remember that you can have as many stretch goals as you want, but the minimum viable product is what's stated on your scope document and you are **committed to producing** that by the deadline. 

> **It is always better to under-promise and over-deliver.**

## How will this project be graded? 

**Requirements:**
* It is clear to the user what the app does
* Adds to the DOM dynamically using JavaScript
* Interacts with the DOM (HTML) using events or taking input from the user
* Modern ES6 variable declarations used (`let`, `const`)
* GitHub repo has more than one significant commit
* App and interactions are accessible
* Site is live on GH Pages or student's own URL
* Errors are handled effectively
* Sass is used
* Files, folders & naming conventions followed (camel case)(this includes your project repo)

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* One external `.css` stylesheet is used for whole project
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

You will also be given marks for your project presentation:
* Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
* Student was able to identify a technical win
* Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
* Student did not go over time

## Submitting your project

1. Remove any unneeded files from the project.
1. Create a repository with a name made up of your own first name, then your last name, and project three (e.g.`firstNameLastNameprojectThree`). 
1. Push your files to GitHub (you should be doing this continuously, not just at the end!)
1. Deploy your website to GitHub Pages or on your own domain/subdomain
1. Submit your repo URL and live URL using [the project submission form](https://forms.gle/NtYaHEfo3EqMsBpJ8).

## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces. 

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of the Bootcamp Designer. ðŸŽ¨

## Lateness
Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
