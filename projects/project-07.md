# Project 7 (personal portfolio)
## Due date
Tuesday, June 18th, 1:00 p.m.

## Project description
A beautiful, responsive portfolio for all your âœ¨amazingâœ¨ work that you've coded from scratch to match your chosen design.

## Project objective
To show off all the skills you've learned in the bootcamp, especially HTML, CSS, and modern web standards.

## Design
The point of your portfolio is to showcase your development skills. As such, we encourage you to code an existing design. You are strongly encouraged to purchase a design from somewhere like [Themeforest](http://1.envato.market/hackeryou) (don't bother with WordPress themes - we want to write our own CSS). You will choose a PSD of a portfolio site design that you like and check the [past portfolio themes doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQqQnn-gSbyRlk_Au_MRoRsttsgy4BRdRnldnoclt6I/edit#gid=0) to make sure a recent grad hasn't used the same one. Once Fatima has approved your design, she'll update the past portfolio themes doc to reflect your choice. Themes can **only** be PSDs (they may not contain **any** HTML or CSS at all).

Resourses to open PSDs without Photoshop:
* https://studio.psdetch.com/
* https://www.photopea.com/ (similar to Photoshop)


> If you are a designer/want to design your own portfolio, you MUST get approval from Fatima.

## How will this project be graded?

If you get a job, you get an A. ðŸ˜‰  

We'll do group critiques/QA before demo night to catch any weirdness.

**Requirements:**
* Have a minimum of 3 portfolio items
* The portfolio itself must be coded in plain HTML and CSS with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript for effects (i.e. your portfolio site CANNOT be React)
* All images considered content have descriptive alt text
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

## Submitting your project
1. Deploy your website and submit the live URL using [the project submission form](https://forms.gle/FQuAaNeSpbTqbwTT8).
  * Your portfolio site **must** be deployed before the critiques or it will not be eligible for review. 

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
