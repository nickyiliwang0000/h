## Design Must Submitted By:

Thursday, August 20th at 6pm

Enter your theme in [THIS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M7mXwg9bOz07I2NW3rM5cO1AKhJHpmXPd1Pi-NpFyOc/edit?usp=sharing) doc. 


## Project description

A beautiful, responsive portfolio for all your âœ¨amazingâœ¨ work that you've coded from scratch to match your chosen design.

## Project objective

To show off all the skills you've learned in the bootcamp, especially HTML, CSS, and modern web standards.

## Design

The point of your portfolio is to showcase your development skills. As such, we strongly encourage that you code an existing design. You can purchase a design from somewhere like [Themeforest](http://1.envato.market/hackeryou) (don't bother with WordPress themes - we want to write our own CSS) or [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/templates/websites). You must submit your design files before starting the project.
<!-- 
You may not update an existing portfolio, you must start from scratch. -->

## Choosing a design

Choose a portfolio site design that:

-   you like!
-   does NOT have **any** HTML or CSS in it (PSD only)
-   no duplicate designs in your cohort 
<!-- -   no recent grad has used (check the [past portfolio themes doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQqQnn-gSbyRlk_Au_MRoRsttsgy4BRdRnldnoclt6I/edit#gid=0)) -->

> Again, even if you are a designer/want to design your own portfolio, consider buying a theme. You can use it as a jumping off place to expidite your design process.

## How will this project be graded?

If you get a job, you get an A. ðŸ˜‰

We'll do group critiques/QA to give and recieve feedback on Friday afternoon.

**Requirements:**

-   Have a minimum of 3 portfolio items
-   The portfolio itself must be coded in plain HTML and CSS with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript for effects (i.e. your portfolio site CANNOT be React)
-   Theme files do not contain any HTML or CSS


**USE THE [DESIGN FLIGHT LIST](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/Juno-Design-flight-list.pdf) TO CHECK YOUR PROJECT FOR COMPLETENESS**

Once you have checked all the items on this list you are ready for Friday's Portfolio Critiques.

Because you are showing off your ability to code, be sure you adhere to the best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:

-   All images considered content have descriptive alt text
-   Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
-   Semantic HTML elements are used properly
-   Setup snippet is used
-   Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
-   Site is responsive and uses media queries

## Submitting your project

1. Deploy your website and submit the live URL using [the project submission form](https://forms.gle/AudGGoSEPRGsBJh66).

-   It is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED that you start your deploy on Wednesday because  there will not be a lot of time on Friday for deployment debugging.
-   Your portfolio site **must** be deployed before the critiques or it will not be eligible for review.


## Design

Please use the [design checklist](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/design-checklist.pdf) to evaluate your portfolio as you are creating it. 

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive portfolio will help you stand out on the job hunt.

<!-- Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of instructor and peer feedback on design during project work time. ðŸŽ¨ -->

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!

Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
