# Project 7 (personal portfolio)
## Due date
Project due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Project description
A beautiful, responsive portfolio for all your âœ¨amazingâœ¨ work that you've coded from scratch to match your chosen design.

## Project objective
To show off all the skills you've learned in the bootcamp, especially HTML, CSS, and modern web standards.

## Design
The point of your portfolio is to showcase your development skills. As such, we strongly encourage that you code an existing design. You can purchase a design from somewhere like [Themeforest](http://1.envato.market/hackeryou) (don't bother with WordPress themes - we want to write our own CSS). Your design files must be complete before starting the project.

You may not update an existing portfolio, you must start from scratch. 

## Choosing a design
Choose a portfolio site design that:
* you like!
* does NOT have **any** HTML or CSS in it (PSD only)
* no recent grad has used (check the [past portfolio themes doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZQqQnn-gSbyRlk_Au_MRoRsttsgy4BRdRnldnoclt6I/edit#gid=0)) 

> Again, even if you are a designer/want to design your own portfolio, consider buying a theme. The day you finish bootcamp you can make a whole new portfolio if you want.

## How will this project be graded?

If you get a job, you get an A. ðŸ˜‰  

We'll do group critiques/QA on Dec 17th before demo night to catch any weirdness.

**Requirements:**
* Have a minimum of 3 portfolio items
* The portfolio itself must be coded in plain HTML and CSS with jQuery or vanilla JavaScript for effects (i.e. your portfolio site CANNOT be React)
* Theme files do not contain any HTML or CSS
* All images considered content have descriptive alt text
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

## Submitting your project
1. Submit your top two theme choices to Fatima for approval by December 12th at 1 p.m. via email (fatima@junocollege.com).
2. Deploy your website by December 17th at 1 p.m. and submit the live URL using [the project submission form]().
  * It is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED that you start your deploy on Monday, as Tuesday morning there will not be a lot of time for deployment debugging.
  * Your portfolio site **must** be deployed before the critiques or it will not be eligible for review. 
  
## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces. 

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of instructor and peer feedback on design during project work time. ðŸŽ¨ 

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
