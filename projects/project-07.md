# Project 7 (personal portfolio)
## Due date
Tuesday, March 19th, 2:00 p.m.

## Project description
Your goal for this week is to build yourself a beautiful portfolio of all your âœ¨amazingâœ¨ work!

## Design
The point of your portfolio is to showcase your development skills. As such, we encourage you to code an existing design. You are strongly encouraged to purchase a design from somewhere like [Themeforest](https://themeforest.net/?ref=HackerYou) (don't bother with WordPress themes - we want to write our own CSS). You will choose a PSD of a portfolio site design that you like and check with Melissa to make sure a recent grad hasn't used the same one. Once Melissa has approved your design, post the link in Basecamp so no one else can use that design. 

If you are a designer/want to design your own portfolio, you MUST get approval from Melissa.

## How will this project be graded?

If you get a job, you get an A. ðŸ˜‰  

We'll do group critiques/QA before demo night to catch any weirdness. Your portfolio sites MUST be deployed before the critiques or they will not be eligible for review. 

**Requirements:**
* Use the skills you have learned up until now!
* Have a minimum of 3 portfolio items
* All images considered content have descriptive alt text
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
