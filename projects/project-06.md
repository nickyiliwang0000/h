# Project 6 (agency-style group React application)
## Due date
Project due dates can be found [here](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/stuff-you-need-to-know/important-dates.md).

## Project description
For this project, we will be mimicking the agency environment. You will be working in small groups to build simple web applications for a client. The projects will be of about the same complexity as your React/API projects from previous weeks, but this week we will be asking you to focus on **delivering a functional product**, **sticking to a timeline**, and **collaborating** with your fellow developers on GitHub.

You'll be expected to create an organization on GitHub, create feature branches, and contribute via the pull request process. 

## Working as a team

You will be given an opportunity to provide feedback about the experience of working with your group members.

>  **It is just as important to make a functional product as it is to work well with your partners.** We take note of who is respectful, willing to take feedback, and mindful of their partners' learning. All members of the team should have a complete understanding of the technical aspects of the project.

It can be valuable to set your group's working expectations from the beginning. Take some time to decide what your group's working hours should be (times that all members are expected to be available and present), how to handle pull requests (how many `üëç` are required before a merge can be executed), and any other arrangements that will help accomodate the needs of your specifc group.  

Since we are also nearing the end of Helpcue, we'll be encouraging you even more than before to use the resources available to you to problem solve before putting yourself in the 'cue'. Use your peers, your bootcamp buddies, and Professor Google! We want to see you making an effort to troubleshoot on your own in order to prepare you for your post-bootcamp life. 

## How will this project be graded?

**Requirements:**
* Uses React, and no jQuery
* Uses flexbox or grid where appropriate
* Uses Axios and/or Firebase
* Every group member has at least one significant commit on GitHub
* React 'knows' about all DOM changes (bind your inputs! don't use vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM! .setState() is always used to alter state!)
* App is dynamic based on user interaction (e.g. drop down menu, search field)
* It is clear to the user what the app does
* App and interactions are accessible
* Errors are handled effectively
* Site is live on student's own URL or GitHub Pages

You will also be given a general mark on how well you adhere to best practices mentioned in class. Best practices include but may not be limited to:
* Extraneous code is removed (including console.log)
* Semantic HTML elements are used properly
* Setup snippet is used    
* Wrapper used to constrain content on large displays
* Site is responsive and uses media queries

You will also be given marks for your project presentation:
* Student was loud enough for everyone to hear
* Student was able to identify a technical win
* Student was able to effectively identify a technical challenge
* Student did not go over time

Note that each student will be given about a minute to speak during the presentation; everyone in your group must speak.

## Project timeline

* **End of day Wednesday:** Organization set up on GitHub, wireframes, game plan/pseudo code and successful return of data from API (if applicable) 
* **End of day Friday:** Beta version of the app
* **End of day Tuesday** Project live on gh-pages (highly recommended if you are using React Router), or your own domain

Commit early, commit often.

## Which project do I do?
You will be provided with a client brief that includes some requirements as well as a style guide that you need to follow.

Find your group [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qw-dnRppkzRaXscOvdPusE1SHsEiSGnHQrPoRf2kujU/edit#gid=1112317742) in the 'Project 6' tab. Client briefs are linked to the group headings.

Your instructors are your clients. They're human! Talk to them! If you want to change something, if you run into a problem, if you have questions about your brief, or if you have an idea about how to do something better because of the data you're getting, **get an instructor to sign off on any changes you want to make**.

## Submitting your project
1. Deploy your website to Firebase Hosting or your own domain/subdomain.
1. One person from the group will submit your repo URL and live URL using [the project submission form](http://bit.ly/HYsubmissions).

## #design in Helpcue

Though design isn't the core focus of the bootcamp, having a well-designed and cohesive project will help provide a professional polish to your portfolio pieces. 

Whether you need advice on colour schemes, fonts, layout or a wider professional opinion, manage your time so that you can take advantage of the Bootcamp Designer. üé®

## Lateness
Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! üëÄ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
