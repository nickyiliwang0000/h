# Project 2 (multi-page PSD conversion)
## Due date
Wednesday, February 6th, 1:00 p.m.

## Project description
This project is meant to emulate a common task you will perform as a front-end developer. You will be provided a design and you will be tasked with building it. The goals here are to execute the designer's vision on the web, and to build a good experience for your users regardless of the device on which they are viewing the site.

## Design decisions
You won't always be provided with the tablet/mobile views from a designer, and this project is meant to put you in that situation. Part of being a front-end developer can be making design/UX decisions - so put some thought into how your users might interact with the site on various devices. Ask your peers for opinions or get ask questions in Helpcue and tag them `#design`. 

Remember that you can discuss font sizes with the designer if you think they are too small to be read comfortably.

## How will this project be graded?

## Which design do I code?
Much like in the workplace, you don't get to choose the design you code - you'll be assigned! 
You can find your assignment [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_Al24ZkClAPSVk_SmDTy4N3q4QX3F1Tf7ukJ2ig13Kk/edit#gid=1618587171).

## Submitting your project
You'll be submitting your project via GitHub and posting the link to the repository on Basecamp.

1. Remove any unneeded files from the project.
1. Create a repository with a name made up of your own first name, then your last name, then `project2`. The way you structure this should match whatever naming convention you pick for your folders, files, classes etc.
1. Push your files to GitHub (you should be doing this continuously, not just at the end!)
1. Post the link to the repository on Basecamp.

## Lateness
Projects handed in on the same date as the deadline but after the requested time (usually 10 a.m.) will receive a 10% penalty. Students will receive an additional 10% deduction for each day the project is late, up to a maximum penalty of 30% (or 3 days late). After 3 days, the project will receive a total mark of 0.

# No plagiarism!! ðŸ‘€ We'll be watching for it!
Plagiairism is presenting someone else's work as your own. When you use other developers' work, you must credit them on the site or in the comments. If you think something in your project walks the line, check with an instructor **before handing in your project**.
