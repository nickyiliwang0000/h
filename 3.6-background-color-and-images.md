## Intro to CSS Backgrounds

With all elements in HTML, we are able to apply a background. This background will appear within the dimensions of the element, and behind any content or other elements that are nested within.

The background of an element can be an image or one of the color formats we discussed before.

## Background Colour

To provide a background color, use the `background-color` property and pass a color value in.

```css
header {
	background-color: black;
}
```

```css
section {
	background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.7);
}
```

```css
p {
	background-color: #008B8B;
}
```

```css
h3 {
	background-color: hsla(90, 30%, 94%, 1);
}
```

_Note: You may have come across the opacity property that can make the background colour appear with a transparency. Be careful with this property in that it will affect all nested content as well._


<div class="accessibility">
Use caution when deciding background and text colours. Low contrasts can make content difficult or impossible to read. The WCAG AA requires a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Logos or brand names have no contrast requirements or minimums. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20#visual-audio-contrast-contrast" target="_blank">This is a great resource for checking colour contrasts</a>, and <a href="http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/#%23555-on-white" target="_blank">this is another great resource, too.</a>
</div>

## Background Images

The CSS Property to use an image instead of a colour is called `background-image`. Specifying the value is a little different because we have to tell the CSS where the image is located on our hard drive. For this we use the value `url()` and pass in the image path.

Just like the `<img>` tag, we can use absolute or relative tags.

```css
body {
	background-image:url(images/dog2.jpg);
}
```

OR

```css
body {
	background-image:url(https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo3w.png);
}
```

By default, the background image will repeat and appear with its native dimensions.


<div class="accessibility">
When should I use a background image (CSS) vs an HTML img element?
When the image matters to the content of your page, we should use an img element. If the image is purely for aesthetics, we should use a background image. Basically, think about whether you would want a screen reader to describe your content or ignore it! 
</div>

## Background Repeat

When using the background image property, the background will repeat by default from the left to the right, and the top to the bottom. Using the `background-repeat` property, we can specify how the background repeats:

**No Repeat, show only once**

```css
header {
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```
**Repeat along the X axis**

```css
header {
	background-repeat: repeat-x;
}
```

**Repeat along the Y axis**

```css
header {
	background-repeat: repeat-y;
}
```

## Background Positioning

When repeating a background-image we need to specify from where it repeats. For this, we use `background-position`. We pass it **two values** which specify the x and y centering. Available values are **top, left, right, bottom** and **center**. By default, the browser is **left top**. If you only specify one value, the other will be 50% or center.

```css
section {
	background-position: left bottom;
}
```

```css
section {
	background-position: center;
}
```

```css
section {
	background-position: right top;
}
```

**Note: `background-repeat` and `background-position` can be used together to specify where you would like a pattern to anchor from**

We can also specify `px` or `%` in place of these keywords

```css
section {
	background-position: 100px 10%;
}
```

When using pixel and percentage values for the background-position property, the first value will refer to the horizontal position of the background, and the second value will define the vertical position. The left top corner is `0% 0%` or ` 0px 0px`. The right bottom corner is `100% 100%`. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_background-position&preval=10px%20200px">Here is a great tool to play around with background-position.</a>

## Background Size

The `background-size` property specifies the size of the background image. This allows the image to be scaled up, or constrained within the dimensions of the element.

```css
header {
	background-size: 100px;
}
```

#### Cover

To have the background image take up the entire **width** of the element use the property of `cover`. If the image ratio is larger than the element itself, it will be cropped.

```css
header {
	background-size: cover;
}
```

#### Contain

A keyword that scales the image as large as possible and maintains image aspect ratio (image doesn't get squished).

```css
header {
	background-size: contain;
}
```

## Background Shorthand

When writing background properties, it can get unruly with all the rules. We can combine all the background properties in a single `background` property name. This is known as writing **shorthand**. This includes an optional background color.

```css
body {
	background: red url(images/dog2.jpg) top right repeat-y fixed;
}
```
Which works out to:

```css
body {
	background: [background-color] [background-image] [background-position] [background-repeat] [background-attachment];
}
```

## Background Gradients

Another really cool feature of background-images is the ability to create gradients in pure CSS. Previously a gradient needed to be exported from something like photoshop.

Background gradients can be created using the `background-image` property, or through the `background` shorthand.

#### Linear Gradient

To create a linear gradient, we use the `linear-gradient()` property and pass a series of values.

```css
div {
	background: linear-gradient( 45deg, blue, red );
}
```

The values provided are the angle in which the gradient will progress along, and the colours of the gradient.

```css
div {
	background: linear-gradient( <angle>, <colour>, <colour> );
}
```

The angle can be provided as keywords or a value in degrees (`45deg`) that originates from the top center of the item.  Keywords that are available for use are prepended by the word 'to' and describe the angle.

```css
div {
	background: linear-gradient( to bottom, blue, red );
}

div {
	background: linear-gradient( to top right, blue, red );
}
```

The gradient can take as many colours as you'd like. These colours will be spread evenly throughout the gradient by default. Keyword, hex, rgb/rgba and hsl/hsla values can be used.

```css
div {
	background: linear-gradient( to right, blue, red, green, yellow, pink, lime );
}
```

To control the position of each colour stop, provide a percentage value next to the colour.

```css
div {
	background: linear-gradient( to right, blue 40%, red, green, yellow, pink, lime );
}
```

#### Radial Gradients

A radial gradient allows you to create a circular gradient as a background. It works similarly to a linear gradient, but doesn't require an angle.

```css
div {
	background: radial-gradient(red, blue);
}
```

```css
div {
	background: radial-gradient(red 10%, blue 25%, green 75%);
}
```
