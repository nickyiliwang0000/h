JavaScript Comments
### Comments
Sometimes you want to write notes to yourself (or others) to organize blocks of code or leave explanations. Just like HTML & CSS, JavaScript will ignore comments and not execute them.

Single line comments can be added with `//`.

```js
// There are 365 days in a year.
```

Just like in CSS,  `/*  */` are used for multiline comments.

```js
/* 
	Many 
	Lines
	wow
*/
```

Multi-line comments are also great for "hiding" large blocks of code so you can try something new without erasing your old code.

Comments are a good thing to get used to using. Comments help you understand your code weeks or months down the road. They also allow you to make your code readable and easy to understand for other developers.
