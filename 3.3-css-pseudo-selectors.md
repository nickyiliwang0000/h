## Pseudo Selectors

With each element present on a page, there are several states that can be associated with it. These states are often when an interaction like a hover or selection has taken place.

Using CSS, we can select elements while they are in these states and apply styles as needed. These selectors are appended right after the main selector with a colon. There are four main pseudo selectors:

**:hover** - used to style an element when the user hovers over it. Often used on links, but can be applied to any element.

```css
a:hover {
	 color: red;
} /* Change links to red when hovered */
```

**:visited** - used to style a link that the user has already visited.

```css
a:visited {
	color: purple;
} /* Change links to purple when visited */
```

**:active** - used to style an element when the user clicks the element.

```css
a:active {
	text-decoration: underline;
} /* Change links underline when selected */
```



**:focus** - used to style an element when in focus. Often useful in form elements.

```css
input.email:focus {
	border:1px solid red;
} /* change border to red when focused */
```

<div class="accessibility">
By default, there is an outline on certain elements when they are focused. There is a trend for people to remove this outline as it does not match the style of your site. However, this is bad for accessibility as this outline is there so that users using a keyboard can see where the focus is. If you are going to be removing the outline make sure you apply whatever style you apply to :hover on :focus as well. :focus should be used in conjunction with :hover.
</div>

## Pseudo Class

We've learned how to select elements through tag names, classes and through states, however there are further ways to extend selectors to be more specific using advanced pseudo selectors.

#### First Child
Using the first-child selector, the first element that is a child of it's parent is selected.

```html
<section>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>
```

```css
section p:first-child {
	color: red;
}
```

results in

<style>
section.example p:first-child {
	color: red;
}
</style>

<section class="example">
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>

#### Last Child
The last child selector performs the opposite task. Selects the last element of the parent.

```html
<section>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>
```

```css
section p:last-child {
	color: red;
}
```

results in

<style>
section.example-last p:last-child {
	color: red;
}
</style>

<section class="example-last">
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>

#### nth-child
The nth-child selector allows you to provide arguments on which child elements to select inside of a parent.

```css
element:nth-child(n) {

}
```

The arguments provided are used to specify which element to select. An example is to pass an argument of 'even' or 'odd' to select each even and odd elements respectively.

```css
element:nth-child(even) {

}
```

```css
element:nth-child(odd) {

}
```

Using the following markup, let's explore how to use pseudo classes
```html
<ul>
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
	<li>item 6</li>
	<li>item 7</li>
	<li>item 8</li>
	<li>item 9</li>
	<li>item 10</li>
</ul>
```

To select all the even `li` elements in the `ul`, we can use the following selector.

```css
ul li:nth-child(even) {
	background: blue;
}
```

Result:
<style>
	ul.evenList li:nth-child(even) {
		background: blue;
	}
</style>

<ul class="evenList">
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
	<li>item 6</li>
	<li>item 7</li>
	<li>item 8</li>
	<li>item 9</li>
	<li>item 10</li>
</ul>

To select the odd elements, we can use the following selector.

```css
ul li:nth-child(odd) {
	background: red;
}
```

Result:
<style>
	ul.oddList li:nth-child(odd) {
		background: red;
	}

	ul.oddList li:nth-child(odd) {
		background: red;
	}
</style>

<ul class="oddList">
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
	<li>item 6</li>
	<li>item 7</li>
	<li>item 8</li>
	<li>item 9</li>
	<li>item 10</li>
</ul>

To go beyond even and odd elements and select elements that with a bit more of a pattern, we can provide more advanced arguments.

To get a specific element, provide the count of the item you want to select.

```css
ul li:nth-child(5) {
	background: blue;
}
```

Result:
<style>
	ul.secondList li:nth-child(5) {
		background: blue;
	}
</style>

<ul class="secondList">
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
	<li>item 6</li>
	<li>item 7</li>
	<li>item 8</li>
	<li>item 9</li>
	<li>item 10</li>
</ul>

To get every 'nth' element, provide an argument with the number of items to select. In the example below, we can select every fourth element.

```css
ul li:nth-child(4n) {
	background: blue;
}
```

Result:
<style>
	ul.fourthList li:nth-child(4n) {
		background: blue;
	}
</style>

<ul class="fourthList">
	<li>item 1</li>
	<li>item 2</li>
	<li>item 3</li>
	<li>item 4</li>
	<li>item 5</li>
	<li>item 6</li>
	<li>item 7</li>
	<li>item 8</li>
	<li>item 9</li>
	<li>item 10</li>
</ul>

#### nth-of-type

So what if we wanted to select the first p tag in the case below?

```html
<section>
	<h3>This is the title</h3>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>
```

```css
section p:first-child {
	color: red;
}
```

results in:


<style>
section.example2 p:first-child {
	color: red;
}
</style>

<section class="example2">
	<h3>This is the title</h3>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>




Does the above code work? No, because the first p tag isn't the first child. The h3 is technically the first child of the section.

This is where nth-of-type comes in handy, as it's more specific. Let's try again using nth-of-type.

```html
<section>
	<h3>This is the title</h3>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>
```

```css
section p:nth-of-type(1) {
	color: red;
}
```

results in:


<style>
section.nextExample p:nth-of-type(1) {
	color: red;
}
</style>

<section class="nextExample">
	<h3>This is the title</h3>
	<p>This is the first sentence</p>
	<p>This is the second sentence</p>
</section>


It worked!
