## Responsive Design


Responsive Design aims to provide the best experience for whatever device a user is viewing a site on; it could be a 27"  display all the way down to a mobile phone screen.

Previously web developers would create what we call "m dot" sites (as in http://m.yousite.com for mobile users), which means we run two independent sites and update them all accordingly when we have new content. One site would be the desktop site and the other would be a mobile friendly site. This takes a lot of developer resources to keep updated.

Responsive design introduces the concept of a single codebase and one website that reacts to its view port. With this, we only have to maintain and update content for a single website versus two+.

### How?

Responsive design is done entirely with well thought out HTML and CSS Media Queries. So far we have been crafting our sites with really clean HTML and percentage-based elements. We are going to see how we can take that a step further and rearrange and restyle our elements based on what screen size we are on.

## Viewport Meta Tag

Before we jump into media queries, it's important to note a new tag that goes in the `<head>` of your HTML document - the **viewport** meta tag.

Meta tags in our `<head>` provide data or information on the current page - anything from keywords to Facebook image paths. The viewport tells browsers (primarily mobile browsers) how to size themselves.

### The tag breakdown

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`

1. **meta is the tag name**. It goes in the head and provides information on the website to any person/browser/robot that may want it. In this case, the mobile browser cares about it.
1. **name of viewport** differentiates it from other meta tags such as keywords - we use **'viewport'** to tell the browser we are providing information about the sizing abilities of the site.
1. **content** is where we provide the information about the **viewport**. We provide as many key-value pairs as we want here, each comma separated.
	1. **width=device-width** tells the browser how wide the website should be. We can set this to a value of, say 320px, and it will render the site as if the website browser was 320px wide. This becomes a problem because there are hundreds of devices out there, all with different sizes. If we set this to the keyword of **device-width** it will automatically assign the value based on how wide the device is.
	1. **initial scale** is the zoom value at which the site is zoomed in/out by default. A value of 1.0 will render the size just as it is, no zoom in or out. A value of 0.5 would zoom it out while 1.5 would zoom it in.
	1. **user-scalable=no** (not shown in tag above), will limit users from being able to zoom into your website. This is helpful if you are providing a mobile-optimized experience and zooming/panning is not required.
	1. **minimum-scale, maximum-scale** will limit how far in or out a user is allowed to scale/zoom your website.

**Main takeaway:** You will **always** want to put the above tag into the `head` of your document. Without the viewport meta tag, your site will **not be responsive** - instead, your site will just render as a shrunk down version of your desktop site. This viewport meta tag won't automatically re-style your site on smaller screen sizes. We will need media queries for that! The viewport meta tag will ensure these media queries actually work.

## Media Query

Once you've added the viewport tag, **media queries** are what actually make your site responsive. Media queries allow you to apply CSS to your document only when the screen matches certain parameters. For simplicity sake, we'll focus mainly on using width and height.

You can code a block of CSS that is _only_ applied at certain points of your website, otherwise it is not applied to your elements.

**A media query.**

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
	body {
		background:red;
	}
}
```

In the above we target all media up to a max-width of 940px.
So, anything **equal or less than** 940px wide will have a red background.

Notice how we nested our CSS inside of what looks like another CSS rule? If we had more than one rule it would look like this:

```css
@media (max-width: 940px) {
	body {
		background:red;
	}
	h2 {
		font-size:20px;
	}
}
```

The above CSS gets applied when the browser reaches a width of **940px or smaller**. This is what we call a **breakpoint**

An easy way to visualize breakpoints is to set either a background color or a border on the body to make it obvious which breakpoint you current are on.

Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/responsive1.html" class="exercise" download>responsive1.html</a> in your editor and browser, and lets take a look through the code.

**What size is my browser right now?!!?**
Dev tools has introduced a ruler that shows you pixel values. You can use that or inspect the body of your page to get the current page width and height.

## Width Media Query

The most common way to use media queries is by targeting the width of a device.

The above example had just a **max-width** where everything below that is applied. This means that anything written in our `@media (max-width: 940px) {` media query will be applied all the down to the smallest screen size.

Occasionally we will want to limit our CSS to a certain range of pixel values and we can do that like so:

```css
	/* Portrait tablet to landscape and desktop */
	@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 940px) { }
```

The above piece of code will only be applied when the width of your browser is greater or equal to 768px **and** less or equal to 940px

This can be helpful when you are targeting a specific size of screen. However if you want your CSS to cascade down to all levels, simply leave out the min-width like we did in our first example. We will have more examples of this later today.

## Height Media Query

Occasionally you may be in a situation where you want to check if a device has a certain height. This happens relatively infrequently, but can be useful to account for content that might not fit on screens with less vertical space. 

For example, a header set to `height: 100vh` with a long title inside might be a problem on older phones with shorter screens, or small tablets in landscape mode; the title could get cut off, or break out of its container. We can avoid this by having the header automatically size itself to its contents once the screen is below a certain height:

```css
header {
	height: 100vh;
	/* For most screens with enough height to contain the content */
}

@media (max-height: 600px) {
	header {
		height: auto;
		/* For shorter screens */
	}
}
```

If the issue only applies when the screen is narrow (like on a phone), squishing the title in and making it longer, you can also mix and match the height media query with width:

```css
 @media (max-height: 660px) and (max-width: 450px) {
	header {
		height: auto;
	}
}
```

**Note:** You shouldn't rely on height too much beyond cases like the one above! Using it for design-based decisions is tricky and unreliable, because browser heights are even more unpredictable than widths. Some things to note:

1. A phone's browser bar takes up height, and there's generally a context menu at the bottom.
2. People may be viewing your site from an in-app browser such as the Facebook or Twitter app.
3. Some people use Google Chrome on the iPhone which takes up a different amount of vertical height.

So, as you can see, trying to target a specific device is not a good idea - you are better off using general width media queries most of the time.

## Orientation Media Query

Orientation is which way you are holding a device - portrait or landscape.

![](http://wes.io/Kk2i/iPhone-5-Black-White-MockUp.png)

The tricky part here is not to think of the width on landscape being bigger than portrait - because thats what width MQs are for. We want to think **how the user is interacting** with the device. If they are holding the device in portrait rather than landscape, there may be a few things to consider:

1. How many hands might they using to touch the screen? Are the in a grocery store line with 1 hand or sitting on the couch?
1. Where might you want to place certain controls, such as buttons on an online game, when they are in landscape vs portrait?

So you might use something like this to target iPad sized tablets:

```css
@media (min-device-width: 768px) and (max-device-width: 1024px) and (orientation: landscape) {
	/* Styles */
}
```

For our purposes and in 99% of the cases, you will be okay with just targeting width of the device.

## Pixel Resolution Media Query

This is where pixels start to bend your mind, especially if you are coming from a print background where everything is in 300DPI and measured in inches.

Pixels are an odd thing that don't necessarily correspond to the size of the screen - a 50 inch 1080p TV is 1080px high while a 9 inch ipad is 1536px high. Lately devices have come out that are what we call HiDPI or High Density Pixels (Apple's "retina screen" is a marketing term for this same thing). The number of pixels on these devices is doubled and crammed into the same sized screen, which results in a much clearer image on the same physical device size.

The important part is that nothing has changed for our CSS - the screen still registers as 320px wide even though behind the scenes it's 640px wide. This is nice because we don't need to write another set of CSS just for HiDPI devices - everything is normalized and all of our text, borders, colors etc. are crisp.

Here is a nice graphic from <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/towards-retina-web/" target="_blank">smashing magazine</a> on the topic:

![](http://wes.io/Kjax/Screen%20Shot%202012-11-07%20at%202.37.48%20PM.png)

The downside to this is that all of our images and graphics are blown up to be 2x the size, which results in blurry images. A fix to this is to use device resolution media queries to sub in images that are 2x the size of the normal one.

```css
.myButton {
	background: url(images/buttonBG.png) center no-repeat;
}

/* feed HiDPI screens a bigger background image */
@media 	(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), 
		(min-resolution: 192dpi) {
			.myButton {
				background:url(images/buttonBG@2x.png) center no-repeat;
        			background-size: 50%;
				/* Because background images appear at the native dimensions, it's recommended to scale the retina-sized images down to 50%. */
		}
}
```

Note that above we use both the more widely-functional `min-resolution` query, and the vendor-prefixed `-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio` to account for a few specific special-requirement cases (for details, take a look at <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-media-resolution" target="_blank">CanIUse</a>).

## Other Media Query

We are really just concerned with device width and sometimes the device height, however there are a ton more ways that you can use media queries

* **color** - if you could somehow get a web browser on an old gameboy color, you could target low or no bits of color.

```css
@media all and (color:0) and (width:160px) and (height:144px) {
	/* Target original gameboy */ 
}
```

* **print** - when someone prints a webpage, it can remove pieces that aren't needed.
* **aspect ratio** - very similar to pixel ratio, used in opera
* **monochrome** - screens such as a kindle
* **progressive scan** - if you are working doing TV web apps
* **mac theme,windows theme** - Target specific themes on mac or windows

## Creating Breakpoints

As a general rule of thumb, we don't want to create breakpoints based on a specific device model. There are hundreds of screen sizes out there and we will only continue to have more screen sizes. Instead, what we can do is, create breakpoints based on our design and content. For certain edge cases, where you want to target specific devices, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/" target="_blank">check out this resource by Chris Coyier that provides media queries for standard device sizes</a>. Below you will also find three **rough** breakpoints that might help you in figuring out when to make layout adjustments.

```css
/* Portrait tablet and small desktops */
@media (max-width: 940px) {
}

/* Landscape phone to portrait tablet */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
}

/* Landscape phones and down */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
}
```

As you design your site, you may need breakpoints that are larger, smaller or in between some of these. Don't feel like you need to use these three exact media queries! Remember, create breakpoints based on your design/content. 


## Responsive Layouts

Finally we get to see the reasoning behind using percentages to size our website divs. It's worth refreshing ourselves on the `box-sizing:border-box;` model.


### Box Sizing review
Here we have a div with padding and border. What happens to the total dimension of our div when we do not include our `box-sizing:border-box`? 

```css
.myDiv {
	background: tomato;
	width: 200px;
	height: 200px;
	padding: 25px;
	border: 5px solid darkcyan;
}
```
We get the following:

<div class="mydiv" style="width:200px; background:tomato; height:200px; padding: 25px; border: 5px solid darkcyan;box-sizing:content-box;">hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello tomato hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello</div>  
  

The dimension of our box grows to be 260px by 260px. When it comes to responsive layout, not having complete control over the dimensions of our elements can give us quite the headache! Without `box-sizing`, our layouts become difficult to maintain. Every time we change the amount of padding and/or border, we need to adjust our width/height. Let's make our developing lives better and add our `.bor-box` snippet.

```css
* { -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; }

.myDiv {
	background: tomato;
	width: 200px;
	height: 200px;
	padding: 25px;
	border: 5px solid darkcyan;
}
```

Now whenever we add border or padding, you'll see that the box stays the same size. The border and padding **eats into** the 200px.

Add padding: 
<div class="myDiv" style="width:200px; background:tomato; height:200px; padding: 25px; box-sizing:border-box;">hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello tomato hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello</div>
<p>The div stays 200px by 200px.</p>   
  
<p>Same goes for border. It takes part of the 200px pie:</p>
  
<div class="mydiv" style="width:200px; background:tomato; height:200px; border:5px solid darkcyan; box-sizing:border-box; padding:25px;">hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello tomato hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello</div>  

<p>So, if you give an element a width of 75%, you can add as much padding and border to it as you want, and it will always take up the same percentage of its parent's width.<p>

```css
.myDiv {
	width:75%;
	padding:5%;
	border:10px solid black;
	/* Everything here adds up to 75% */
}
```
However, **margin is not included in this**.

If you were to add 5% margin to a 75% width element:

```css
.myDiv {
	width:75%;
	margin:5%;
	/* This adds up to 85% of the parent */
}
```
The entire element needs 85% of the parent width. Our border-box snippet will only accommodate for border and padding. Adding margin will still increase the total dimension of your element.

## Max Width on Responsive Sites

Now that last example worked great, but what if we only want our site to be so a certain width on desktops and then scale down past that?

Easy, we just use a CSS property called `max-width` which will allow it to be any size with up to this value.

Open up our last example and let's add the following code:

```css
.wrapper {
	max-width:960px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Scaling down images

This is a common problem that happens when your desktop images are large enough to fill the required space, but when you size down the device size, the images are way too big.

Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/responsive3.html" class="exercise" download>**responsive3.html**</a> to get an idea of this issue.

The fix is easy. We just need to apply a max-width to all images. This ensures that images will never be bigger than their parent element.

```css
img {
	max-width: 100%;
}
```

## Responsive Testing

Testing responsive designs are really easy and you don't need a mobile device to do it!

You simply need to resize your browser to the approximate size of your device. Here are a few more tips:

1. Dock your dev tools to the right of the screen. Click the gear icon in the bottom right of dev tools and check 'Dock to right'
1. You may want to break your dev tools away into a new window - click the window icon in the bottom left corner to pop them out.
1. Check out the new firefox developer tools responsive design view. Go to `Tools` --> `Web Developer` --> `Responsive Design View`
1. Chrome has a similar device emulator. Click the phone icon in your devtools toolbar to open it and test out different screen sizes and connection speeds.

### Helpful Patterns
There are a lot of common patterns and problems that you will find when it comes to creating a responsive site. There is a great resource from Brad Frost called <a href="https://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html" target="_blank">Responsive Patterns</a> that will give you a lot of great examples and code for common issues.
