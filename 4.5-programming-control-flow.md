Control flow

Normally, instructions or **statements** in a JavaScript are executed one after the other, in the order in which they are written. 

**Control flow** is referring to the order of instructions that are executed based on a decision and is used to change the flow of statements. 

An example of a control flow statement is an if/else statement.

"If this condition is true, do this. Else, do this."

#### Booleans

Our code so far is executed top to bottom. If that's all we could do then our programs would be limited. This is where **control flow** comes in. We can write code so that a statement or group of statements is only executed if a logical condition is true or false.

A type of value that we need for conditionals is the **boolean** type. This type has two possible values: `true` or `false`. For example, when checking if two numbers are equal the value returned should be either true or false. How to we check it two numbers are equal? We use comparison operators.

#### Comparison operators

Operator     |  Description  
------------ | -------------
==	 | is equal to 
===	 | is exactly equal to (value and type)
!=	| is not equal to
!==	| is strictly not equal to
>	| greater than 
<	| less than
>=	| greater than or equal to	
<=	| less than or equal to



Check equality with `===` (equal) and `!==` (not-equal). Note how we **do not use regular equals**. Why?

Check inequality with `>=` `<=` `>` `<` (greater than and less than)

**Exercises**: In the console, write two expressions that return the boolean value `false` and two that return `true`.

#### Combining boolean expressions

In order to make more complex conditions we can use logical operators to check for something like. If `2 is equal to 2 AND 3 is greater than 1`.

**Logical operators**  

&&  = **AND** <br>
|| =  **OR** <br>
!   = **NOT** <br>

We can combine boolean expressions using (`&&`) and (`||`) operators.

Most often you will use `&&` to determine if two statements are both true, for example:

```js
const cow = "mammal";
const feet = 4;

cow === "mammal" && feet > 2 // returns true, since cows are mammals and they have more than two feet

cow === "mammal" && feet > 6 // returns false, because even though cows are mammals, they have fewer than 6 feet!
```

Most often you will use `||` in situations where you only care if at least one of the conditions is true, for example:

```js
const age = 30;
const name = "Steve";

age > 25 || name === “McLovin”
```

This will return true if EITHER the age variable is greater than 25 AND/OR the name variable is equal to “McLovin”.

The only time an `||` will return false is if NEITHER condition is true. So if age is less than 25, AND name is not equal to “McLovin”, this statement will return false.

**NOTE:** One fun and weird quirk of JavaScript is that every value in JavaScript can be compared to any other value in JavaScript. For example, `0`, `null` and `undefined` will all evaluate to ‘false’, whereas any string (`“Kristen”`, `“pizza”`), or any number higher than `0` will evaluate to true.

Values that evaluate to false (like `0`, `null`, and `undefined`) are known as `falsey` values, whereas values that evaluate to true (any number bigger than 0, strings, etc.) are considered `truthy` values.

This might seem strange at first, but we’ll learn more about why this is useful in the coming lessons.

### Conditional statements
Now that you're familiar with booleans, it's time to meet **conditional statements**. Simply put, these statements allow us to run a statement or group of statements only when a condition is true or false.

Here is the syntax for an if/else statement:

```js
if (condition) {
	// block statement (do something)
} else {
	// block statement (do something)
}
```


Let's break that down.

1. `if` is a keyword
2. `condition` is usually a boolean expression
3. `block statement` will be explained below
4. `else` is a keyword. 
5. another `block statement`. Note that the `else` block is optional.

#### Block Statements
A block statement is used to group statements (instructions). The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets `{}`:

```js
if ( time === 'morning') {
   // do all of the following things
   console.log("Good morning!");
} else {
	// do all the following things if the first condition is false
	console.log("Good evening!");
}
```

In fact a block statement could be just the `{}`.

```js
{
	console.log('Hi!');
}
```

**Exercises**: Complete the following exercises in pairs. Put your code between `<script>` tags inside of an HTML file.


1. Consider the code below; what is printed to the console?

```js
const n = 4;

if (n > 10) {
	console.log("That's a big number");
} else {
	console.log("It's a small number");
}
```


2. Create a quizzing program. The program asks a question, the user is prompted to answer, the answer is checked and then a score is printed to the console.

3. Consider the code below; what is printed to the console? What is `else if`?

```js
const n = 55;

if (n > 100) {
	console.log("That's a big number");
} else if (n > 10 ) {
	console.log("It's kinda big");
} else {
	console.log("It's a small number");
}
```

4. Create a simple "rock-paper-scissors" game. Prompt the user to enter their choice of "rock", "paper" or "scissors" and store this value in a variable. Always compare the user's input with the value "rock" (we'll work on making this more dynamic later). If the user's input is "paper" then print to the console "You Win!". If the input is "rock" then print "Tie" and print "You Lose" if the user's input is "scissors".
