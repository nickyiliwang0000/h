# The React Component Lifecycle

When we talk about the lifespan of a human, we talk about the stages of their life: childhood, adolescence, adulthood, old age. Well, just like humans, React components have their own lifespan, called their *lifecycle*.

And just like the stages in a human's life, React components have stages called *lifecycle methods*.

## What are the Lifecycle Methods
Sometimes, you will find you need to perform a little bit of business before you're ready for your component to render on the page. Maybe you'd like to make sure you have a piece of data that you're retrieving from an API, or you'd like to make sure a user is authenticated to view the page that they've requested. Lifecycle methods can help you do that.

Lifecycle methods allow you to intervene at various stages of a React component's lifecycle (i.e. its creation/birth, updating/life, and destruction/death), in order to perform some kind of action. Since you don't have direct access to the React codebase, these lifecycle methods offer an opportunity for you to interact with and inject your own code into what would otherwise be a black box.

When a method allows you to intervene in the process of an existing piece of code, this is often called a *hook*.

## Mounting and Unmounting
Let's start with a bit of terminology.

Whenever a React component gets added to the DOM, it's called *mounting*. We say that the component successfully *mounted* to the DOM. 

When a React component is removed from the DOM, it's called *unmounting*. We say that that component successfully *unmounted*.

There are many React lifecycle methods (see [The Component Lifecycle](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html), visualized here:

You don't need to know all of these methods, especially when first starting out. We're going to focus on some of the most important ones. 

When a component is mounted to the DOM, four lifecycle methods trigger:
* **constructor()** - This is where you do things like set initial state and bind any functions to your component.
* **componentWillMount()** - This method is currently being deprecated and isn't recommend for use.
* **render()** - Here's where you will determine what gets displayed to the page.
* **componentDidMount()** - This is where you'll do things like make AJAX requests for data you'd like to use in your component. 

When a component unmounts from the DOM, only **componentWillUnmount()** gets called.

## Using the lifecycle methods
Hooking in to the lifecycle methods is very straightforward - we've actually already done it with both `render()` and `constructor()`! 

In order to access the lifecycle methods, simply reference them inside of your component:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
        // here is our constructor lifecycle method
    }

    componentWillMount() {
        // currently being deprecated, please don't use unless you're 100% sure you need to!
    }

    render() {
        // here is any DOM elements we want to display on the page
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        // here is anything we want to happen after the component renders - like grab our AJAX data
    }
}
```

## Codealong: Building an Instructor Page
We're going to use React, AJAX, and the lifecycle methods to build a page that lists out all of the instructors.
