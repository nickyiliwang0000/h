# React Events


We should be somewhat familiar with events from our time spent with jQuery. An event is something that the browser does, or something that the user does.

For example, when a button is clicked, this is called a *click event*.

Events are typically made up of two parts:
1. the event (user clicks the button)
2. the event handler (some code that runs when the user clicks the button).

In jQuery, we handled events like this:
```javascript
$('button').on('click', function(){
	// some event handler code we would like to run when the button is clicked
});
```

In React, things work a little bit differently. First we begin by attaching our event handler to the DOM element of choice like so:

```javascript
class Button extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>
 		)
	}
}
```

and then we write an 'event handler' method inside of our component that describes what we want to happen when the button is clicked.

```javascript
class Button extends Component {
	handleClick() {
		alert('That tickles!');
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>
 		)
	}
}
```
