# React Events

We should be somewhat familiar with events from our time spent with jQuery. An event is something that the browser does, or something that the user does.

For example, when a button is clicked, this is called a *click event*.

Events are typically made up of two parts:
1. the event (user clicks the button)
2. the event handler (some code that runs when the user clicks the button).

In jQuery, we handled events like this:
```javascript
$('button').on('click', function(){
	// some event handler code we would like to run when the button is clicked
});
```

In React, things work a little bit differently. First we begin by attaching our event handler to the DOM element of choice like so:

```javascript
class Button extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>
 		)
	}
}
```

and then we write an 'event handler' method inside of our component that describes what we want to happen when the button is clicked.

```javascript
class Button extends Component {
	handleClick() {
		alert('That tickles!');
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</button>
 		)
	}
}
```

State describes the part of an application that changes over time.

Think about your Facebook account. At any given point, you're either logged in or you're not logged in. Facebook needs to know which one is true so that you can either be shown the login screen or your personal profile.

Information about your login status is stored inside of the 'state' of the Facebook application.

So somewhere, deep within the bowels of the code for Facebook, there's probably an object that looks like this:

```javascript
user = {
	loggedIn: false
}
```

When you log in, `user.loggedIn` is set to true. Your action of logging in changed the state of the application.

## State in React
In React, each one of your components can have it's own state, where it can store information that is relevant to that particular component.

For example, let's imagine it's 1995 and we want to have a sweet visitor counter to keep track of how many people have been to our page.

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				You are visitor number 57.
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

Let's imagine that I have some mechanism that can keep track of how many people have visited my page. As more people visit my site, the number 57 is going to need to be updated - it is the part of our application that changes over time. This is a sign that it's a good candidate to be stored in state.

Here's how we would move the information about our visitors into our state:

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {
			visitors: 0
		}
	}
	render() {
		<div>
			You are visitor number {this.state.visitors}.
		</div>
	}
}
```

There's a few new pieces of code here, so let's break down we've added

* `constructor()` - by inserting the constructor method into our Counter component, we are able to set default properties, such as the state, of our new component
* `super()` - when using the `extends` keyword, super is required to gain access to the `this` keyword
* `{this.state.visitors}` - Remember that anything inside curly brackets is vanilla JavaScript - here we are literally just accessing the `state` object on the `Counter` component, and printing out the value of the `visitors` property on to the page. Since `this.state.visitors` is set to 0 by default, our counter will print out `0` until we find a way to increment the counter

Try modifying the value of `this.state.visitors` inside the constructor - you'll notice that the change is reflected when we refresh the page!
Now that we have an understanding how state and events work, let's combine them together to build a simple 'counter' mechanism that can count up from 0.

We'll start by creating our Counter class:
```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
			 <p>I am currently on number: 0</p>
			 <button>Increment</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

Cool! We know that the number 0 is going to need to change over time (as the counter increments it), so let's move it over into the state:

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {
			count: 0
		}
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
			 <p>I am currently on number: {this.state.count}</p>
			 <button>Increment</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

Here we've created a `count` property in our `state` object, which we set inside our constructor. Then instead of just printing out the number 0, we use `this.state.count` to print out whatever the current value of the count is.

## Adding in Events
Now let's make it so that we can increment the counter when the button gets clicked.

Let's start by attaching an event listener to the button:

```javascript
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
			 <p>I am currently on number: {this.state.count}</p>
			 <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
```

We add the `onClick` attribute to the button and set it to be equal to a function called `this.handleClick`, which we'll create now:

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {
			count: 0
		}
	}
	handleClick() {
		this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
			 <p>I am currently on number: {this.state.count}</p>
			 <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Increment</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

Inside of `handleClick`, you'll notice we're calling a method you haven't seen before: the `setState` method. `setState` allows us to update the current state of our application by passing in an object containing the piece of state we want to update.

In this case, since we want to update `this.state.count`, we pass in an object with a key of `count` and a value of what we want to update `count` to, in this case, we want to set it to what it was before plus one.

This all makes sense, so let's try running our code and clicking our button.

```bash
Error! `app.js:20521 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'setState' of null`
```

It looks like the value of `this` is `null` inside of our `handleClick` method when we try to set our state!

This is a particular quirk of ES6 where the `this` value isn't bound when `handleClick` is called. Not to worry, this can be fixed very easily by changing how we define the method

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
	constructor() {
		super();
		this.state = {
			count: 0
		}
	}
	handleClick = () => {
		this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1})
	}
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				{this.state.count}
				<button onClick={ this.handleClick }>Increment counter!</button>
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

It works! You'll notice that every time you click the increment button, the number on the page increases! This is because every time `setState` is called, our component **rerenders**, which basically means it "refreshes" itself and grabs the most up to date state information.

Let's break down what we did here step by step:

* We start by declaring our new Counter component. In its constructor, we set the state of the component to include a `count` property with a value of 0.
* We then added a click event listener to our button by adding an `onClick` attribute and passing in the `handleClick` method as its value
* When the increment counter button is clicked, `this.handleClick` is called
* `this.handleClick` calls `this.setState`, which allows us to update the `count` property inside of our component's state by adding one to its current value.
* `this.setState` causes the component to re-render, which updates the number that appears on the page.

And that's all there is to it! `onClick` is just one of many different events that React can handle - there's also `onMouseOver`, `onMouseDown` etc. - [check out the React docs for the full list](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html).
