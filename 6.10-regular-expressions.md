You might come across regular expressions if you need to check for patterns within string. They look a little complex at first glance, but they are very powerful if you can get your head around them.  

One common use case is form validation. For example, we could check to see if a user's submitted email address in a valid format like `name@domain.tld`. 

A **regular expression** (abbreviated regex) is a sequence of characters used for pattern matching in strings. Regular expressions can be thought of as their own language. They are implemented in many other programming languages, not just JavaScript.

The syntax for a regex is `/` , then a pattern to match, then a closing `/`.

```js
let re = /abc/;
```
This regex would match the characters, "abc".

#### Checking for a match with `exec`

To check to see if a regex pattern has any matches in a string, we can use the `exec` method. It returns either an array of the matches or `null` if it doesn't find anything. 

```js
let re = /abc/;
re.exec("I'm learning the alphabet."); //returns null
re.exec("Now I know my abc's"); //returns "["abc"]";
```

#### Regex for string replacement

You can also use a regex pattern in the `replace` string method.  

```js
let name = "HackerYou";
let newName = name.replace(/You/, "U"); //returns "HackerU"
```

Regex can do a lot more than just replace a simple string of characters. You can use it to catch multiple things at once. 

We can make our replace function search for both upper and lower case Y's by matching a set of characters instead of just capital Y. We use `[]` to indicate a set of characters to match.

```js
let name="HackerYou";
let newName = name.replace(/[Yy]ou/, "U"); //name="HackerU"

let name="hackeryou";
let newName = name.replace(/[Yy]ou/, "U"); //name="hackerU"
```

You can also use what are called **flags** to change the way the search behaves.  Adding the `i` flag to the end of a regex means 'case insensitive'.

```js
let name="hackeryOu";
let newName = name.replace(/You/i, "U"); //name="HackerU"
```

Some other common symbols:

`*` => match multiples<br>
`.` => match any character except line breaks<br>
`\w` => match all words <br>   
`\W` => match all non-words  <br>  
`\d` => match any digit <br>   
`\s` => match any whitespace character   <br>  
`[a-z]` => match a range of characters   <br>  
`[^cd]` => match characters NOT in the set    <br>

### Some examples of Regex Patterns that you might find in the wild:

#### Matching a username that has a length between 3 and 16 characters.

Pattern
`/^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$/`

Let's break down what's happening here:
`^` => find the beginning of a string<br>
`[a-z0-9_-]` => followed by any lowercase letter (a-z), number (0-9), an underscore or a hyphen<br>
`{3,16}` => make sure that there are at least 3 characters, but no more than 16<br>
`$/` => Notes the end of the string<br>

#### Matching an email address:

Pattern
`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

Let's break down what's happening here:
`^` => find the beginning of the string<br>
`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)` => match one or more lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, or hyphens<br>
`@` => Next is an @ sign<br>
`([\da-z\.-]+)` => This is the domain name, which must be one or more lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, or hyphens<br>
`\.` => another escaped dot<br>
 `([a-z\.]{2,6})` => the domain, which is between 2 to 6 letters or dots (for domains like .co.uk)<br>
`$/` => Notes the end of the string<br>

#### Writing Your Own Regular Expressions

There are lots more patterns and flags, and you'll probably never remember them all, so don't be afraid to:

##### 1. google for someone else who's written the same regex before

If you're looking for something common like email address validation, you can usually find a pre-written regex online.

##### 2. use a regex tester

<http://www.regexr.com/> We love this online regex tester. You can test your regex against your own text to quickly see if you've got it working. The sidebar also contains a reference of all the different symbols and flags available, and some common examples to get you started.
