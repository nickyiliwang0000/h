#Display and positioning

## The `display` property
Let's take a look at some markup:

```html
<span>I'm a span</span>
<span>I'm a span</span>
<span>I'm a span</span>
<div>I'm a div</div>
<div>I'm a div</div>
<div>I'm a div</div>
```

How will the above be displayed in the browser? Let's open [display.html](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/display.html) in the browser and check it out.

Why do the spans line up beside each other and the divs start on a new line when their contents are almost identical?

![](http://wes.io/K21R/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-09%20at%2011.25.42%20AM.png)
The elements have a pink background and some margin added to see their shape better.

Because default display value for `span` is `inline` and the default display value for `div` is `block`. 

The `display` property specifies the type of box that will be used when rendering an element on the page - a box that takes up only the space it needs, or a box that takes up the whole line.

### `display: inline;`
Elements that have the `display:inline;` property (hereafter called _inline elements_) can be nested inside elements that have the `display:block;` property (a.k.a. _block elements_).

Write the following HTML inside of `display.html`:

```html
<p>My favourite foods are <span class="food">pho</span> and <span class="food">hamburgers</span>. Read <em>more</em> about me on my <a href="http://mywebsite.com">website</a>!</p>
```

Notice how we wrapped different words in an `a` or an `em` or a `span` and everything stays in a line in the browser rather than breaking on to a new line? That's because by default, these elements are `display:inline;`.

1. Set a width of 400px on `span.food`, what happens?
2. Try changing the `span`s to `div`s. See what happens.

Inline elements do not accept a width because their default behaviour is to only take up as much space as they need and continue on with the content within that element.

### `display:block;`

Block elements break onto a new line. Block elements are often the containers for inline elements. Block elements accept a width, which is why we use them to lay out our pages.

Some examples of block elements are `div`, `h1-h6`, `p`, `ul/ol`, `li`, and `blockquote`

### `display: inline-block;`

Inline-block is the best of both worlds - you can set a width or height on the element, like block elements, but it will still display side-by-side in the line, just like inline elements. 

Images are the only element that are by default `display:inline-block;`. 

Let's see how it works with some markup:

```html
<p>Here is a picture of a star: <img class="myStar" src="https://www.fillmurray.com/100/100">. Isn't it nice?</p>
```
If we wanted to set a width and height on the image, we totally could and it doesn't break to a new line.

Let's try it with the link from the last example:

```css
a.myLink {
    width:300px;
    height:50px;
    background:red;
    display:inline-block;
}
```
Notice how it now sets the width and remains inline? We will do a bunch of exercises involving `display` soon, so get pumped!


## `display:none;`

`display` can also have the value of `none`. It does exactly what you might think it does: hides the element entirely. The space that the element would take up is removed as well, and any subsequent content takes up the space that is available.

As well, using `display: none` on content removes it from a screen reader. Visually it will be not shown, and the content will not be read.

### display: none vs visibility: hidden

Another property that appears to perform the same task as `display: none` is `visibility: hidden`. When using this property, it makes the element hidden, yet the space that the element would occupy remains.

## Manipulating the `display` property
Sometimes you may want an anchor tag or `span` to have a set width. We can use CSS to change the `display` property. 

Take this markup:

```html
<p>Here is my link to <a href="http://google.com" class="myLink">Google</a>.</p>
```

and some CSS

```css
a.myLink {
    width:300px;
    background:red;
    display:block;
}
```

Notice how when we switch from the default `display:inline;` to `display:block;`, the element takes the 300px width and breaks to a new line.


## Positioning

So far, we've been working with `float` or `display` to make elements fit snugly beside each other. This works great most of the time.

But, what happens when we want a little more control over how to position elements on the screen? What if we want to:

1. Bump something up and over a few pixels?
1. Overlap two elements or have something burst outside of its wrapper.
1. Place an element in the top right corner, regardless of how wide or tall the div is? (Like an X to exit a modal box)
1. Overlap text on top of an image.

So far, every time we add more content to our page, the page gets longer. This is where the `position` property comes in handy. Positioning is the tool to use when making stylistic tweaks, but be sure not to use it for layout though.

### Default of position:static

All elements in HTML are by default `position:static;` which means that they aren't positioned at all, they just **take up the space they need** and other elements start after them.

This is what we have worked with so far. You'll won't need to set `position:static;` on an element unless you are overriding something you have set earlier.

## position: relative

`position: relative;` acts just like what we are used to (static). The element still takes up the space it needs to but there is one major difference.

When we position something as **relative**, we unlock the ability to use four more properties: `top`,`right`,`bottom`,`left`. These can be used to nudge the element around.

Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-relative.html" class="exercise" download>position-relative.html</a> in your editor and do the following:

1. Position the `.box` div to relative.
1. Try using a `top` and `left` value of 100px each.
1. Try a negative left value (-100px).
1. Replace your `top` with `margin-top`. What is the difference?
1. Let's try it with 120% width.

Where exactly is top, left, right and bottom referring to? 

## position: absolute

`position: absolute` is another way of positioning elements on a page. When you absolute position an element, it no longer takes up the space it used to and is now essentially 'floating' on your screen, above the surrounding elements.

You can now position an absolute value exactly where you want it to go. Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-absolute.html" class="exercise" download>position-absolute.html</a> in your browser and editor. Here we have four 100px square divs, all `position:static` (the default).

Go ahead and set .blueBox to position absolute:

```css
.blueBox {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    position: absolute;
}
```

What just happened? Where is the red .redBox? Why is there suddenly a purple box? The blue box was set to **position: absolute** and no longer takes up any space, so naturally the red box just bumps itself right up and under the blue box. Since the background of these divs have a bit of transparency, you can see some of the red underneath shine through the blue box, making a purple div. If we were to remove the transparency for all of our divs, what three colors would be visible?

Let's play with positioning the blue box:

```css
.blueBox {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    position: absolute;
    top: 500px;
    left: 120px;
}
```
Or use bottom and right values:

```css
.blueBox {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 20px;
    right: 20px;
}
```

You can also use percentages:

```css
.blueBox {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    position: absolute;
    width: 5%;
    height: 5%;
    top: 45%;
    left: 45%;
}
```

You'll notice that the box can be positioned at any point on the screen and it doesn't care if there is content where it wants to go or not, it just overlaps everything.

Now, where do you think top, left, right and bottom referring to?

## Combining position relative and absolute

The last example was good for understanding absolute positioning, but chances are you won't just have elements loose like that in your layout, you will have a wrapper, a sidebar, content or some kind of container.

This is where we need to mix `relative` and `absolute` positioning. Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position.html" class="exercise" download>**position.html**</a> in your browser and editor.

Let's write some code so the blue box is positioned like this:

![](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-absolute-relative-1.png)

Our first thought may be to do something like this:

```css
.box2 {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    position: absolute;
    top: -20px;
    right: 20px;
}
```

And that is right, but why is it positioned way outside of the wrapper div? Try resizing your browser too.

That's annoying. We want it to be absolute to the top right of the wrapper, not the body!

And this is the power of mixing `relative` and `absolute`:

**When you set the position of an element to absolute and use top, right, bottom, left, it is absolutely positioned with respect to its next parent that has a position other than static.**

So, because we do not have any parent elements set to `relative`, its positioning is with respect to the `<body>` or the browser window.

Easy fix for this is to position our `.wrapper` as relative:

```css
.wrapper {
    width: 400px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    border: 2px solid #BADA55;
    
    /* This relative position will contain the absolute positioned child elements within this box. They will still be absolutely positioned, but now with respect to this box, rather than the body. */
    position: relative; 
}
```

#### Another Example

Let's take another shot at this. Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position2.html" class="exercise" download>position2.html</a> in your browser and editor.

Here we have two divs nested inside of each other: `.wrapper` and `.innerWrapper`

We want to end up with something that looks like this:

![](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-absolute-relative-2.png)

Our first step would be to position all boxes `absolute` and position them in the 4 corners:

```css
.box {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 5px;
    position: absolute;
}
.box1 {
    background: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.7); /*semi transparent orange*/
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
}
.box2 {
    background: rgba(65, 105, 255, 0.7); /*semi transparent blue*/
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
}
.box3 {
    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7); /*semi transparent red*/
    bottom: 0;
    right: 0;
}
.box4 {
    background: rgba(0, 138, 0, 0.7); /*semi transparent green*/
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
}
```
So why are the boxes in the corners of the browser even though they are nested inside of two wrapper divs?

![](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-absolute-relative-3.png)

That is because both wrapper divs are at their **default position of `static`** and not `relative`.

## position: fixed

The final type of position is similar to `position:absolute` but it **stays in place when you scroll**.

Let's open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/position-fixed.html" class="exercise" download>position-fixed.html</a> in your browser and editor.

We have a black header at the top. Let's try and use CSS to make it fixed when we scroll:

```css
.fixedHeader {
    position: fixed;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    width: 100%;
}
```

Now try and scroll down. See how the header sticks in place?

When an element is position fixed, we need to provide a width. By default, it will only take up the width of the content. 

The footprint for the position fixed element also disappears. 

## z-index

In one of the earlier exercises, we saw how elements overlap each other. What if we want them to overlap another way? How do we specify which element goes on top and which one goes under?

We are used to working with X and Y coordinates in web design but now we need to think of elements in a third, z-dimension.

For starters, when applying a z-index, **it is only effective when an element is positioned absolute, relative, or fixed**.

The value we use for the z-index can be any whole number. You'll often see people assign the value of 9999 which is a huge number that they hope to defeat everything else on the page.

Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/z-index.html" class="exercise" download>**z-index.html**</a> and you'll see we have our four blocks back.

They are all positioned absolutely and are overlapping each other. By default, the order in which they appear in the HTML determines how they overlap. The first element in the HTML has the lowest z-index and the last element has the highest.  We manipulate that order by using the `z-index` property and manipulating the number value.

![](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/z-index-original.png)

Let's use z-index to bring the red box on top of everything else:

```css
.box3 {
    background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.7); /*semi transparent red*/
    top: 60px;
    left: 60px;
    z-index: 1;
}
```
See how the red box is now above everything else? 

Try changing the orange box to `z-index:2;`.
