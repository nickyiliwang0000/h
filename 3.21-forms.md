# Forms 
Forms are collections of inputs that are used to take in information from a user. When submitted, a form sends that information to a server, which does something with it.
<!-- 
## Client-server communication
A server is a big computer somewhere else that hosts our websites. A form is an HTML element that renders in a user's browser. The information a user enters is captured when they submit the form because the browser takes the user's information and makes a call to the server to tell it that information.  -->

There are three major parts to forms:

1. `input`: Input elements accept information from a user. The most common inputs are text boxes that might ask you for something like your email address, password, or username. Other types include checkboxes, ranges, or radio buttons.
1. `label`: This element lets users know what each input is for.
1. `fieldset` : This element groups parts of a form together
1. `form`: This element is how we how we group `fieldset` elements together. All inputs and fieldsets inside of a `form` tag belong to that form and will be sent over the internet when that form is submitted.

Let's take an example of Twitter.com and break it down:

![Twitter form](http://f.cl.ly/items/3B3u1Y251y1E322q3P0x/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-17%20at%2012.37.19%20PM.png)

We see here two different forms:

1. The sign-in form
1. The register form

They both have different types of inputs depending on what you want to do. Each form has four inputs:

* The sign-in form has an email input, a password input, a checkbox for if you want it to remember your password, and a submit button.
* The register form has name input, an email input, a password input and a submit button.

When the login form is submitted, it sends the information in the inputs to the servers at Twitter.com who then check if the information is correct. If it is, they display your dashboard. If not, they show you an error screen.

The important thing to note here is that we use a form to send information from the **browser** to the **server**.

## The server side
When we work with forms, we are dealing with what are called _server side technologies_, which means a computer in the cloud computes what it is sent based on some logic on the server. In our last example, Twitter will check its database to make sure that:
1.  There is someone by the username of `joeschmoe` 
2.  The password supplied is a match of the one they have on file for the user `joeschmoe`.

With just HTML and CSS, we can't really do much with forms. That is because HTML only creates the form and the browser only sends the information to the server. Once it hits the server, it's up to them to do what they want with it. Such things include:

- checks if username and password match
- uploads a photo
- post a new listing on Craigslist
- add a comment on a blog post
- post a tweet/update to a user's timeline

We won't be touching on any server side languages in this course, but if you do want to explore what happens once you submit the form to the server, you look into learning a language such as Ruby (Ruby on Rails framework), PHP (Code Igniter/WordPress), Python(Django), NodeJS (JavaScript on the server), ASP /.NET (Microsoft products).

Lucky for us, there are services that do the entire server side part for us. A service like [http://www.focuspocus.io/](http://www.focuspocus.io/) or [https://formspree.io/](https://formspree.io/) will send the data from our forms to a specified email. 
*Sidenote: formspree will only work if your site is live.*

## Input types
Open up [this file](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/inputs.html) and follow along with the input examples. 

### `input[type=text]`
The most common input is a text input:

```html
<input type="text">
```
### `input[type="email"]`

It works like a text input except that when the form is submitted, it will throw an error if the text inside is not a properly formatted email address. 

```html
<input type="email">
```

### `input[type="password"]`

Again, similar to a text input but changes characters to dots so the password isn't revealed.

```html
<input type="password">
```
### `input[type="search"]`

Again, exactly like input text, but in some browsers it provides a &times; to clear the search box as well as some different styling.

```html
<input type="search">
```

### `input[type="color"]`

A new input in HTML5 - it looks like a color picker in Chrome and Firefox. Edg [It's not supported in Safari or Edge yet](https://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color), so it will render as a text input.

```html
<input type="color">
```

### `input[type="submit"]`

This one is technically an input, but you probably think of it as a button. The submit input is the magic button that submits the form and sends the information to the server.

```html
<input type="submit">
```
### `button[type=submit]`

When `<button>Submit</button>` is inside a form element, it acts exactly like `<input type="submit" />`. This means if a user clicks the button, the form will submit.

```html
<button type="submit"></button>

```
### `button[type=reset]`
If a user clicks this button, all the elements in the associated form will be reset. This means all inputs and textareas in that form will be cleared and reset.
```html
<button type="reset"></button>
```

#### `button` vs. `input` 

* Buttons can have content, because of the opening and closing tags. 
	```html
	<button>
		<img src="cutepuppy.jpg" alt="really cute puppy in a bath" >
		Click me!
	</button>
	<!-- vs. -->
	<input type="submit" value="Click me!">
	```
* The button element has default styles in the browser.

* Buttons and anchor elements are accessed differently by keyboards. Button elements are triggered by the space bar or the enter key, while anchor elements (links) can only be triggered by the enter key. 

### `input[type="file"]`

This input allows the user to select a file from their computer.

```html
<input type="file">
```

You can also pass it a `multiple="true"` attribute to allow for multiple file selection:
```html
<input type="file" multiple="true">
```

### `input[type="range"]`

Allows you to implement sliders - handy for when users need to gauge something based on a numerical value. 

```html
<input type="range">
```
You can set the max and min values using attributes, as well as a step value.

```html
<input type="range" min="30" max="150" step="10">
```

### `input[type="hidden"]`

This is similar to `display:none;`, safer because the input will still be hidden even if your CSS doesn't load.

Hidden inputs are most often used to store metadata related to the page:

```html
<input type="hidden" value="3Xrg54@Scds!">
```
Sometimes that value means nothing to the user.

## Input attributes
We've talked a bit about attributes specific to the inputs we've seen. Here are  some common attributes that many inputs share.

### `name`
Each input should have a name. Sometimes, as in checkboxes (which we'll look at a little further down the page), the same name is used to denote a grouping of options. Other times, it's information about what the input is for.

```html
<input type="color" name="themeColor" >
<input type="range" name="favoriteNumber">
```

### `value` 
You can set the default value on any input by simply setting the value attribute

```html
<input type="text" value="The honorable">
<input type="color" value="#ff00dd">
<input type="range" value="10">
<input type="submit" value="Send it to the server!">
```

###  `placeholder`
This attribute denotes the default text in your input that clears when a user starts typing. Placeholder is **not** read by a screenreader. 

```html
<input type="email" placeholder="Please enter your email address">
```

Notice that it's different from `value`, which doesn't clear.

### `maxlength`
This attribute limits the number of characters an input can take.

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="Please choose a username" maxlength="6">
```

### `required` 

This attribute stops the form from being submitted unless it has been completed. (Before HTML5 we needed to use JavaScript to check if inputs were valid, but now we have the `required` attribute!)

```html
<input type="text" name="firstName" required="true" placeholder="First name">
<input type="text" name="lastName" required="true" placeholder="Last name">
```

### `disabled`

This attribute disables a form element when its value is true or when it is included without an equals sign. Disabled elements will not receive focus and therefore will be skipped when a user tabs through (it will not be read out by a screen reader). The values of disabled elements are not editable and they will not be sent to the server. 

```html
<input type="text" value="I will not get sent to the server!" disabled>
<!-- is the same as writing -->
<input type="text" value="I will not get sent to the server!" disabled="disabled">
```
Add the disabled attribute to an element and you will notice it is grayed out - this is default styling from the browsers.





## The `label` element

The `label` element is used to label an input. We can still use regular HTML elements (`p`, `section`, `strong`, etc.) inside forms, but it's best practice to use a label element to label form inputs.

A basic form might look like this:

```html
<form action="login.php">
	<label for="username">Your Username:</label>
	<input type="text" id="username">

	<label for="userpass">Password</label>
	<input type="password" id="userpass">

	<input type="submit" value="Log me in!">
</form>
```

We use the input's `id` attribute to connect it to the appropriate label. The `for` attribute exists to make the forms accessible for screen readers. Notice that when we click the label for a checkbox or radio button, it's as though we've clicked the box or button! That's thanks to the connection between the label and the input's `id`.

It's common to see designs where labels are omitted from form elements in favor of placeholders. This is problematic because as soon as a user starts typing in a field, the placeholder disappears, so users no longer have instructions on what the input is for. Also, placeholders will never be read by screen readers. It's important to use labels to ensure all users understand what an input is for - before, during, and after - they use it.

If you don't have control of the design, still use labels but hide them using a class. Consider the following CSS:
	
```css
.visuallyhidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
		position: absolute;
		width: 1px;
		height: 1px;
		margin: -1px;
		border: 0;
		padding: 0;
		white-space: nowrap;
		clip-path: inset(100%);
		clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
		overflow: hidden;
}
```

This is going to hide the content. We need to have a height and width of 1px, because anything smaller won't be read by a screenreader. There's a few new CSS properties in there, like `clip` and `clip-path`. All this is doing is ensuring visual users won't be able to see the content. You can also add this class to text that describes icons.

It's a good idea to include the `visuallyhidden` class in all of your base styles and use it as necessary.

## A word about attributes
> It may seem wrong, but sometimes you will have code that looks like this:

```html
<label for="address">Address</label>
<input type="text" name="address" class="address" id="address">
```

That's totally okay! The attributes all have separate purposes!
## The `fieldset` element
The this is a semantic element that groups inputs. Browsers will add a bit of default styling to `fieldset` elements. When you use `fieldset`, you get access to a `legend` element that acts like a label.

```html
<fieldset>
	<legend>Tell us about you!</legend>

	<label for="firstName">First Name</label>
	<input type="text" name="firstName" palceholder="First name here" id="firstName">

	<label for="lastName">Last Name</label>
	<input type="text" name="lastName" placeholder="Last name here" id="lastName">
</fieldset>
```
## More input types
### `input[type="radio"]`
Radio buttons are useful when you want users to select **one thing** from a list of options. We can group them together by giving them the **same name value**

```html
<fieldset>
	<legend>Select your pizza size:</legend>
	<label for="smallOption">Small</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="small" id="smallOption">

	<label for="mediumOption">Medium</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="medium" id="mediumOption">

	<label for="largeOption">Large</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked="true" id="largeOption"> 
</fieldset>
```

`checked="true"` will by default select a radio button. You may sometimes also see:

```html
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked>
	<!-- OR -->
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked="checked">
```

Both are valid and work the same as `checked=true`.

### `input[type=checkbox]`
Checkboxes are useful when you want users to select as many things as they want from a list of options:

```html
<fieldset>
	<legend>Pizza toppings</legend>
	<label for="olives">Olives</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="olives" name="topping" value="olives" checked>

	<label for="mushroom">Mushroom</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="mushroom" name="topping" value="mushroom" checked>

	<label for="bacon">Bacon</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="bacon" name="topping" value="bacon">

	<label for="sunDriedTomatoes">Sun Dried Tomatoes</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="sunDriedTomatoes" name="topping" value="sunDriedTomatoes">

	<label for="pineapple">Pineapple</label>
	<input type="checkbox" id="pineapple" name="topping" value="pineapple">
</fieldset>
```
Note how each one has the same `name` attribute but different `value` attributes.
<!-- 
#### Why is my form not sending multiple values for my checkbox inputs?
In some cases, you will need to append a set of square brackets to whatever value you give the name attribute (e.g `name="topping[]"`). The square brackets indicate that the values should be accepted as an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">array</a>. Simply, attaching the square brackets tells your script to accept multiple values for your checkbox inputs. For our example above, we have left out the square brackets - sometimes attaching the square brackets can give you a bit of trouble if you're handling the data using JavaScript (more on JavaScript in our Advanced Web Development course). If you find that the service you are using to submit the form is not handling multiple values as expected, try appending the square brackets to the end of your name value.  -->

### `textarea`

This element is the weird cousin of the input bunch: it's not actually an input tag **and** it allows for multiple lines. Also, it requires a closing tag, but no content goes between the tags!

```html
<textarea name="specialInstructions" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
```
This element has two new attributes: `cols` and `rows`. This value is the number of characters the element can hold vertically and horizontally. 

<!-- These attributes are no longer required: we can just use widths and heights, but it's nice to know. -->

### `select`
The `select` element is useful when you want users to select **one thing** from a list of options. The browser usually styles it as a dropdown menu. Unlike radio buttons, the options don't need to share a name. They get their own tag: `option`.

```html
<select name="levelOfSpiciness">
	<option value="noSpice">No Spice</option>
	<option value="mild">Mild </option>
	<option value="medium">Medium</option>
	<option value="spicy">Spicy</option>
	<option value="deathlySpicy" selected>Death.</option>
</select>
```
In the above example, the `value` attribute is what gets sent to the server and the text in between the option tags is what the user sees. To set the default option, use the `selected` attribute. `selected="true"` and `selected=selected` are also valid.
Note that we cannot use any HTML inside of an option tag.

## The `form` element

The `form` tag takes a number of attributes which specify information about the form. Let's take a look an example contact form:

```html
<form action="sendEmail.php" method="POST" class="applicationForm" autocomplete="off" name="applicationForm">
	<!-- inputs go here -->
</form>
```

1. The value for `action` is the address of a server side file that will handle the information sent to it. In this example, it is a PHP file called sendEmail.php. This could be a URL or a relative path. 
1. The value for `method` is generally `POST` or `GET`, which are two ways of sending information to a server. `POST` is used when sending secure information like passwords. You generally won't need to worry about this until you get into developing with a server side language.
1. Just like any other element, we can add a `class` (or an `id`) to a form.
1. You can apply `autocomplete` to the entire form or a specific input. With the value `off`, the form or inputs won't be autocompleted by the browser. There are also two others called `autocorrect` and `autocapitalize` which you can set to off if you are developing for that pesky autocorrecting iPhone.
1. The `name` attribute can be applied to both the form and its inputs. It's basically a way of referencing the form when you get into both JavaScript and server side languages.

## Writing CSS for forms

Before we start writing CSS to make our form inputs look a little nicer, let's take a look at a new type of selector that we can use.

In addition to styling inputs by targetting their element type or class:

```css
input {
}

input.emailAddress {
}
```

We can also select them based on their type:

```css
input[type=email] {

}
```
This can be a great selector to use to reset browser defaults.

### Styling `select` elements

Often, in a design, a dropbown will need to be designed beyond the default browser styling for the `select` tag. This includes a custom dropdown icon. The `select` element (and most other form elements) will need their default browser appearance "turned off" to make styling easier.

```css
select {
	-moz-appearance: none;
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	border: 1px solid black;
}
```
With the `appearance` set to `none`, we are free to apply our own styles. The arrow icon will also be removed from the `select` element.

To put your own custom arrow on the select element, we can get creative with a background image. 

```css
select {
	-moz-appearance: none;
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	border: 1px solid black;
	background-image: url(http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/cc_mono_icon_set/blacks/16x16/br_down.png);
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: 95% center;
}
```

Styling the options when they come up isn't easy - lots of places use workarounds to maintain their website's styles.
