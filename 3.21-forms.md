## Forms 

There is one part of HTML markup that we haven't talked about yet, and that is HTML Form.

Simply, forms are a collection of inputs that are used to take in information from a user. When submitted, that information is sent to a server and then the server analyzes the data and does something with it.

There are two major parts to forms:

1. **inputs** - Inputs are ways that we can collect information from a user. The most common inputs are plain text boxes that might ask you for something like your email address, password or name. There are many types of inputs which we will look into in a second.
1. **The form itself** - The form is how we how we group **sets of inputs** together. All inputs inside of a form tag belong to that form and will be sent over the internet when that form is **Submitted**

Let's take an example of twitter.com and break it down:

![](http://f.cl.ly/items/3B3u1Y251y1E322q3P0x/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-17%20at%2012.37.19%20PM.png)

We see here two different forms:

1. The sign in form
1. The register form

They both have different types of inputs depending on what you want to do.

The first one has 4 inputs: an email input, a password input, a checkbox for if you want it to remember your password and a submit button.

The second one has 4 as well: Name, email, password and a submit button.

When the log in form is submitted, it sends the information in the inputs to the servers at twitter.com who then check if the information is correct. If it is, they display your dashboard, if not they show you an error screen.

The important thing to note here is that we use a form to send information from the **browser** to the **server**.

## The Server side
When we work with forms, we start to dip into what we call **server-side technologies**, which means a computer in the cloud computes what it is sent based on some logic on the server. In our last example, twitter will check its database to make sure that 1) There is someone by the username of `joeschmoe` and 2) the password supplied is a match of the one they have on file for the user `joeschmoe`.

With just HTML and CSS, we can't really do much with forms. That is because the HTML only creates the form and the browser only sends the information to the server. Once it hits the server, it's up to them to do what they want with it. Such things include:

- checks if username and password match
- uploads a photo
- post a new listing on craigslist
- add a comment on a blog post
- post a tweet/update to a users timeline

We won't be touching on any serverside languages in this course, but if you do want to explore what happens once you submit the form to the server, you look into learning a language such as Ruby (Ruby on Rails framework), PHP (Code Igniter/WordPress), Python(Django), NodeJS (JavaScript on the server), ASP /.NET ( Microsoft products).

Lucky for us, there are services that do the entire server-side part for us. A service such as <a href="http://www.focuspocus.io/" target="_blank">http://www.focuspocus.io/</a> or <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank">https://formspree.io/</a> can help us send the data from our forms to the specified email. 
*Sidenote: formspree will only work if your site is live.*

## Form Element

The form tag itself is very simple. It takes a number of **attributes** to specify some information about the form. Let's take a look an example contact form.

```html
<form action="sendEmail.php" method="POST" class="myForm" autocomplete="off" name="myForm">
	... inputs go here ...
</form>
```

1. **action** is the address of a serverside file that will handle the information sent to it. In this example, I have a PHP file called sendEmail.php
1. **method** - Generally POST or GET which are two ways of sending information to a server. POST used when sending secure information like passwords. You generally won't need to worry about this until you get into developing with a serverside language.
1. **class** - Just like any other element, we can add classes (and an id) to a form
1. **autocomplete** - This can be applied to the entire form or a specific input. It disables the autocomplete that your browser might fill in for you. There are also two others called **autocorrect** and **autocapitalize** which you can set to off if you are developing for that pesky autocorrecting iPhone.
1. **name** can be applied to both the form and its inputs. It's basically a way of referencing the form when you get into both JavaScript and server-side languages

## Input[type=text]

The most basic and most common input is a text input

```html
<input type="text">
```

Makes: <input type="text" name="firstName">

As we would with a div, span or any other element, we can add a class to our inputs and then use CSS to style it:

```html
<input type="text" class="myInput" name="firstName">

<style type="text/css">
	.myInput {
		padding:10px;
		border:2px solid blue;
		width:400px;
		font-size:40px;
		color:green;
	}
</style>
```

<input type="text" class="myInput" name="firstName" style="padding:10px; border:2px solid blue; width:400px; font-size:40px;color:green;">

## Character Limit attribute

Limit the number of characters a box will take. Useful for limiting how long a username can be.

```html
<input type="text" name="userName" placeholder="max 6 chars please" maxlength="6">
```

<input type="text" name="userName" placeholder="max 6 chars please" maxlength="6">

## Required Attribute

Another handy part of HTML5 allows us to easily make an input required. Before this we needed to use JavaScript to check if inputs were valid, now we just pass the required attribute

```html
<form action="sendEmail.php" method="POST" name="myForm">
	<input type="text" name="firstName" required="true">
	<button>Submit</button>
</form>
```
<form onsubmit="return false"">
<input type="text" name="firstName" required="true">
<button>Submit</button>
<form>

## Disabled Attribute

Disables a form element when the attribute is included. Disabled elements will not receive focus and therefore will be skipped when a user tabs through (it will not be read out by a screen reader). The values of disabled elements are also not editable and they will not be sent to the server. Sometimes you will notice a disabled element greyed out on its own, this is expected, as it is a common default styling that browsers will provide.

```html
<input type="text" value="I will not get sent to the server!" disabled>
<!-- is the same as writing -->
<input type="text" value="I will not get sent to the server!" disabled="disabled">
```

<input type="text" value="I will not get sent to the server!" disabled>

## Value Attribute

You can set the default value on any input by simply setting the value attribute

```html
<input type="text" name="phoneNumber" value="416-">
```

<input type="text" name="phoneNumber" value="416-">

Note: there is also an input for phone numbers called `<input type="tel">`

## Placeholder Attribute

If you want to have default text in your input that clears when a user starts typing, use the **placeholder** atrribute.

```html
<input type="email" name="emailAddress" placeholder="Please enter your email address">
```
<input type="email" name="emailAddress" placeholder="Please enter your email address" style="width:100%; font-size:20px;">

## Label

There is a third type of element that is associated with HTML forms and that is the `<label></label>` tag.

A label is used to simply label an input. We can still use all our regular HTML - paragraphs, headings, strong, etc.. - inside of forms, but its best practice to use a label when naming an input.

A basic form might look like this:

```html
<form action="login.php">
	<label for="username">Your Username:</label>
	<input type="text" id="username">

	<label for="userpass">Password</label>
	<input type="password" id="userpass">

	<input type="submit" value="log me in!">
</form>
```

Makes:


<label for="username">Your Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username">

<label for="userpass">Password</label>
<input type="password" id="userpass">

<input type="submit" value="log me in!">



We use the **id** attribute of the input to associate the label. The **for** attribute is purely to make the forms accessible for screen readers.

We can also assign an id on checkboxes and radio buttons that matches the for of the label. Then, when we click the label, the checkbox/radio will select itself:

<label for="delivery">Delivery</label>
<input type="radio" name="method" id="delivery">

<label for="pickup">Pickup</label>
<input type="radio" name="method" id="pickup">

```html
<label for="delivery">Delivery</label>
<input type="radio" name="method" id="delivery">

<label for="pickup">Pickup</label>
<input type="radio" name="method" id="pickup">
```

It may seem wrong, but sometimes you will have code that looks like this:

```html
<label for="address">Address</label>
<input type="checkbox" name="address" class="address" id="address">
```

Totally ok! The attributes all have separate purposes.

<div class="accessibility">
	<p>It's common to see designs where labels are omitted for form elements, and placeholders are used instead. This is problematic. As soon as a user starts typing in a field, the placeholder disappears, and users will no longer have instructions on what the input is for. Also, placeholders will never be read by screen readers. It's important to use labels to ensure all users understand what an input is for -before, during, and after- they use it. </p>
	<p>If you don't have control of the design, you can still use labels, using a visually hidden class. Consider the following css:</p>

	
```css
	.visuallyhidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
		  position: absolute;
		  width: 1px;
		  height: 1px;
		  margin: -1px;
		  border: 0;
		  padding: 0;
		  white-space: nowrap;
		  clip-path: inset(100%);
		  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
		  overflow: hidden;
	}
```


<p>This is going to hide the content. We need to have a height and width of 1px, because anything smaller won't be read by a screenreader. There's a few new CSS properties in there, like clip and clip-path. All this is doing is insuring visual users won't be able to see the content. You can also add this class to text that describes icons.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to include the visually hidden class in all of your base styles, and use it as necessary.</p>
</div>

Part of HTML5, this is a new input. It works exactly like a text input but it will validate the input for a properly formatted email address. This is pretty new so if the browser doesn't support it, it will just fall back to a text input.

```html
<input type="email" name="email">
```

Try submitting this form with an invalid email address like 'email$test'

<form> <input type="email"> <input type="submit"> </form>​

![](http://wes.io/KEjD/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-17%20at%201.34.48%20PM.png)

## Input[type="password"]

Exactly like input type="text" but changes characters to dots so the password isn't revealed.

```html
<input type="password">
```

<input type="password">

## Input[type="color"]

Another new input as of HTML5 - will fall back to input text if not available in an older browser.

```html
<input type="color" name="colorOfPepper">
```

<input type="color" name="colorOfPepper">

## Input[type="submit"]

Input type=submit is technically an input, but you would probably think of it as a button. The submit input is the magic button that submits the form and sends the information to the server.

```html
<input type="submit">
```

<input type="submit">

You can style the submit button in any way you want, the above is just a default styling for your browser. More on this in a bit.

You can use the `value` attribute to change the text inside of the button.

```html
<input type="submit" value="Heyo! I've finished the form so you can send it now!">
```

<input type="submit" value="Heyo! I've finished the form so you can send it now!">

## Button Element

### Button Elements

But wait! Haven't we seen button elements around? What to do they do and when should we use them?

#### Button Element in Forms
The Button Element can be a **form element**. When you use a `<button>Submit</button>` in a form element, it acts exactly like `<input type="submit" />` would. This means if a user clicks the button, the form will submit.

Another cool thing the button element can do in a form is be set to type="reset". So if we have something that looks like this, `<button type="reset">Reset</button>` and a user clicks the button all form elements will be reset. This means all inputs and textareas in that form will be cleared and reset.


#### Button vs Input Element

Buttons can have content, because of the opening and closing tags. 

```html
<button>
	<img src="cutepuppy.jpg" alt="really cute puppy in a bath" >
	Click me!
</button>
```

VS 

```html
<input type="submit" value="Click me!">
```


#### Button vs a Element

Using the `<button>` element gives you some cool default CSS in the browser. It really does look like a button.

If you want to link to something just use the `<a>` tag.


Sometimes developers use `<a>` elements, but the href doesn't point anywhere ex. `<a href="#">`.

This is used a lot for **JavaScript** when we want to add some functionality, but not necessarily link to a new page or section. A good example of this would be a lightbox. Devs use the `<a>` tag to get the default styles of the `<a>` tag, such as the cursor on hover.


<div class="accessibility">
Buttons and anchor elements are accessed differently through keyboards. Button elements are triggered by the space bar or the enter key, while anchor elements (links) can only be triggered by the enter key. 
</div>

## Input[type="file"]

This input allows the user to select a file from their computer.

```html
<input type="file" name="profilePicture">
```

<input type="file" name="profilePicture">

You  can also pass it a `multiple="true"` attribute to allow for multiple file selection.

## Input[type="search"]

Again, exactly like input text, but in newer browsers it provides a &times; to clear the search box as well as some different styling.

```html
<input type="search">
```

<input type="search" name="q">

## Input[type="range"]

Allows you to implement sliders - handy for when users need to gauge something based on a numerical value. 

```html
<input type="range" name="levelOfCheesiness">
```

<input type="range" name="levelOfCheesiness" style="width:100%;">

You can set the max and min values as well as a step value.

```html
<input type="range" name="levelOfCheesiness" min="30" max="150" step="10">
```

<input type="range" name="levelOfCheesiness" min="0" max="250" step="20" style="width:100%;">

## Input[type="hidden"]

Hide an input with input type="hidden". This is similar to display:none, but the better way to go about it in the case that your CSS doesn't load.

This input is often used to store meta data related to the page. Sometimes codes that mean nothing to the user:

```html
<input type="hidden" value="3Xrg54@Scds!">
```
Gives us:

<input type="hidden" value="3Xrg54@Scds!">

[lol]

## Input[type="radio"]

Radio buttons are useful for when you want users to select from a list of options but only click one. We can group them together by giving them the **same name value**

```html
	<label for="small">Small</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="small" id="small">

	<label for="medium">Medium</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="medium" id="medium">

	<label for="large">Large</label>
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked="true" id="large"> 
```
<label for="small">Small</label>
<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="small" id="small">
<label for="medium">Medium</label>
<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="medium" id="medium">
<label for="large">Large</label>
<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked="true" id="large"> 

`checked="true"` will by default select a radio button. You may sometimes also see:

```html
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked>
	<!-- OR -->
	<input type="radio" name="pizzaSize" value="large" checked="checked">
```

Both are valid and work the same as `checked=true`

## Checkbox

### checkboxes
Very similar to radio buttons but with the ability to check multiple values. 

```html
<label for="pepperoni">Pepperoni</label> 
<input type="checkbox" id="pepperoni" name="topping" value="pepperoni">

<label for="olives">Olives</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="olives" name="topping" value="olives" checked>

<label for="hotsauce">Hotsauce</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="hotsauce" name="topping" value="hotsauce">

<label for="mushroom">Mushroom</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mushroom" name="topping" value="mushroom" checked>

<label for="bacon">Bacon</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="bacon" name="topping" value="bacon">

<label for="sunDriedTomatoes">Sun Dried Tomatoes</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sunDriedTomatoes" name="topping" value="sunDriedTomatoes">

<label for="pineapple">Pineapple</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="pineapple" name="topping" value="pineapple">
```

<label for="pepperoni">Pepperoni</label> 
<input type="checkbox" id="pepperoni" name="topping" value="pepperoni">
<label for="olives">Olives</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="olives" name="topping" value="olives" checked>
<label for="hotsauce">Hotsauce</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="hotsauce" name="topping" value="hotsauce">
<label for="mushroom">Mushroom</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="mushroom" name="topping" value="mushroom" checked>
<label for="bacon">Bacon</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="bacon" name="topping" value="bacon">
<label for="sunDriedTomatoes">Sun Dried Tomatoes</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sunDriedTomatoes" name="topping" value="sunDriedTomatoes">
<label for="pineapple">Pineapple</label>
<input type="checkbox" id="pineapple" name="topping" value="pineapple">

Note how each one has the same **name** but different **value**

#### Why is my form not sending multiple values for my checkbox inputs?
In some cases, you will need to append a set of square brackets to whatever value you give the name attribute (e.g `name="topping[]"`). The square brackets indicate that the values should be accepted as an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp">array</a>. Simply, attaching the square brackets tells your script to accept multiple values for your checkbox inputs. For our example above, we have left out the square brackets - sometimes attaching the square brackets can give you a bit of trouble if you're handling the data using JavaScript (more on JavaScript in our Advanced Web Development course). If you find that the service you are using to submit the form is not handling multiple values as expected, try appending the square brackets to the end of your name value. 

## Textarea

Textarea is the weird cousin of the bunch, its not an input tag and it allows for multiple lines. It **does** need a closing tag, however no content goes between the tags.

```html
<textarea name="specialInstructions" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
```

<textarea name="specialInstructions" id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>

Here we see two new attributes: **cols and rows**. This value is the # of characters the text area can hold vertically and horizontally.

Note:  Columns and rows are no longer required. we can just use widths and heights!

## Select Element

This one is a little different because it contains multiple elements - you can think of it as similar to an unordered list.

First we have a `<select></select>` tag and inside of that, we define the available options with the `<option></option>` tag.

```html
<select name="levelOfSpiciness">
	<option value="noSpice">No Spice </option>
	<option value="mild">Mild </option>
	<option value="medium">Medium</option>
	<option value="spicy">Spicy</option>
	<option value="deathlySpicy" selected>Death.</option>
</select>
```

<select name="levelOfSpiciness">
	<option value="noSpice">No Spice </option>
	<option value="mild">Mild</option>
	<option value="medium">Medium</option>
	<option value="spicy">Spicy</option>
	<option value="deathlySpicy" selected>Death.</option>
</select>

In the above example, the **value** attribute is what gets sent to the server and the text in between the option tags is what the user sees.

Note that we cannot use any HTML inside of an option tag.

## Form CSS

Let's start coding some CSS to make them look a little nicer.

Before we jump into that, lets take a look at a new type of selector that we can use.

Selecting all inputs is easy:

```css
input {

}
```

Or we could add a class to the ones that we want:

```css
input.emailAddress {

}
```

But we can also select them based on their type

```css
input[type=email] {

}
```

This can be useful to set browser defaults. For simplicity's sake, we will stick with classes today.

### 	Styling Select elements

Often, in a design, a select box will need to be designed beyond the default browser styling. This includes a custom dropdown icon. To create a custom look, Select elements and most other elements will need their default browser appearance 'turned off'.

```css
select {
	-moz-appearance: none;
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	border: 1px solid black;
}
```

With the appearance turned off, we are free to apply our own styles, such as background, borders and typography. As well, the arrow icon will be removed from the select element.

<select style="appearance: none; -webkit-appearance:none; border: 1px solid black; background: none;">
	<option value="">Option 1</option>
	<option value="">Option 2</option>
	<option value="">Option 3</option>
</select>

To put your own custom arrow on the select element, we can get creative with a background image. 

```css
select {
	-moz-appearance: none;
	-webkit-appearance: none;
	appearance: none;
	border: 1px solid black;
	background-image: url(http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/cc_mono_icon_set/blacks/16x16/br_down.png);
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: 95% center;
}
```
<select style="appearance: none; -webkit-appearance:none; border: 1px solid black; background-image: url(http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/cc_mono_icon_set/blacks/16x16/br_down.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: 95% center;">
	<option value="">Option 1</option>
	<option value="">Option 2</option>
	<option value="">Option 3</option>
</select>
