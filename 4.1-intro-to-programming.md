Intro to programming
### Introduction to JavaScript

*A programmer’s partner sends them to the grocery store with instructions: "Get a litre of milk. If they have eggs, get a dozen."*

*The programmer comes home a short while later, an armful of milk cartons in tow.*

*"Why did you get so much milk?" the programmer's flabbergasted partner asks.*

*The programmer replies, "They had eggs."*


#### A Quick Primer on Programming Languages


So far, we've created our projects using HTML and CSS, tools that allow us to add content and style to our pages. But what if we wanted to do more complex things on a page? Things like adding interactivity, responding to events, communicating with services, or modifying styles on the fly?

For that, we need to have a deeper conversation with the computer. We need a programming language. 

Programming languages are used to communicate a set of instructions to a machine. There are many different programming languages for different situations / projects: Objective-C and Swift are used for iPhone apps. Java is used for Android apps. Ruby, Python, PHP, and Node.js can be used for the backends of websites and web apps. 

For things that happen in the browser, we primarily use a language called JavaScript.

Since programming is like having a conversation in a foreign language with your computer, sticking to the rules — known as the **syntax** — specific to each language is important. For example, spitting out the text "Hello World" is different in each language. Let's look at a few examples:

#### C 

```c
main() {
	printf("hello, world");
}
```


#### Java 

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
alert('Hello World!');
```

OR

```js
console.log('Hello World!');
```

The role of a programmer is to think of a solution to a real-world problem and break the solution down into "code" (simple mechanical instructions that the computer can understand). The computer simply runs the series of instructions in it's environment.

#### Think Like A Computer

As we've already discussed, learning a new programming language is a lot like learning a new spoken language - there are new words and rules to learn, and the best way to learn is by practicing speaking that language.  

It also helps to try and "think like a computer."  Our spoken language is very rich in comparison to most programming languages. We have to be much more explicit than in English and break down instructions into very small steps when speaking a computer's language.

**Let's try it together.** 

Imagine that an alien of average human intelligence but with **very basic English vocabulary** has landed in the classroom. How would you give this alien instructions for getting to the washrooms?  

Tell them it's "just down the hall"? What if they don't know what "hall" means?

We'll have to be more specific.  Think about breaking down all the little steps that are involved in getting to the washroom.

* Go to the door. Maybe we even have to specify which door out of multiple doors should be used. Maybe we even need to specify "walk forward 10 steps, turn to your left, walk 3 steps" to even *get* to the door.
* Open the door.
* Walk through the door.
* Turn to the right.
* etc.

It seems like we're explaining things in *too* much detail, but this strategy is very helpful in translating things like "I want to save the user's picture to their profile when they click the green button" into a bunch of lines of code that accomplish that.


#### Exercise: Computerthink

In small groups, write out detailed step by step instructions for how to make a cheese and spinach omelette.  We'll compare your answers together to see just how specific you can get!
