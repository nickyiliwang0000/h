## Intro to Programming

### Introduction to JavaScript

*A programmer’s partner sends them to the grocery store with instructions: "Get a litre of milk. If they have eggs, get a dozen."*

*The programmer comes home a short while later, an armful of milk cartons in tow.*

*"Why did you get so much milk?" the programmer's flabbergasted partner asks.*

*The programmer replies, "They had eggs."*


#### A Quick Primer on Programming Languages


So far, we've created our projects using HTML and CSS, tools that allow us to add content and style to our pages. But what if we wanted to do more complex things on a page? Things like adding interactivity, responding to events, communicating with services, or modifying styles on the fly?

For that, we need to have a deeper conversation with the computer. We need a programming language. 

Programming languages are used to communicate a set of instructions to a machine. There are many different programming languages for different situations / projects: Objective-C and Swift are used for iPhone apps. Java is used for Android apps. Ruby, Python, PHP, and Node.js can be used for the backends of websites and web apps. 

For things that happen in the browser, we primarily use a language called JavaScript.

Since programming is like having a conversation in a foreign language with your computer, sticking to the rules — known as the **syntax** — specific to each language is important. For example, spitting out the text "Hello World" is different in each language. Let's look at a few examples:

#### C 

```c
main() {
	printf("hello, world");
}
```


#### Java 

```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
alert('Hello World!');
```

OR

```js
console.log('Hello World!');
```

The role of a programmer is to think of a solution to a real-world problem and break the solution down into "code" (simple mechanical instructions that the computer can understand). The computer simply runs the series of instructions in it's environment.

#### Think Like A Computer

As we've already discussed, learning a new programming language is a lot like learning a new spoken language - there are new words and rules to learn, and the best way to learn is by practicing speaking that language.  

It also helps to try and "think like a computer."  Our spoken language is very rich in comparison to most programming languages. We have to be much more explicit than in English and break down instructions into very small steps when speaking a computer's language.

**Let's try it together.** 

Imagine that an alien of average human intelligence but with **very basic English vocabulary** has landed in the classroom. How would you give this alien instructions for getting to the washrooms?  

Tell them it's "just down the hall"? What if they don't know what "hall" means?

We'll have to be more specific.  Think about breaking down all the little steps that are involved in getting to the washroom.

* Go to the door. Maybe we even have to specify which door out of multiple doors should be used. Maybe we even need to specify "walk forward 10 steps, turn to your left, walk 3 steps" to even *get* to the door.
* Open the door.
* Walk through the door.
* Turn to the right.
* etc.

It seems like we're explaining things in *too* much detail, but this strategy is very helpful in translating things like "I want to save the user's picture to their profile when they click the green button" into a bunch of lines of code that accomplish that.


#### Exercise: Computerthink

In small groups, write out detailed step by step instructions for how to make a cheese and spinach omelette.  We'll compare your answers together to see just how specific you can get!

## Pseudocode

Sometimes when you're writing JavaScript and other programming language it can be helpful to map the detailed steps your program will carry out in plain English, just like we did above.  This is called **pseudocode** and it's a very helpful strategy for getting your ideas about how a program runs out down without worrying about the specific syntax of how to write it. Think of it like outlining an essay with point form notes before going back and filling in each point with complete sentences.

```json
when the user scrolls down the page:
* measure how far they've scrolled
* if they've scrolled more than 400px
	- show a tooltip
* otherwise
	- hide the tooltip
```

## Javascript

Instructions to the computer are given by using a series of 0’s and 1’s. Programming languages, such as JavaScript, have been created to allow us to communicate with the computer in a more natural way.

**HTML** defines the content.  
**CSS** defines the presentation.  
**JavaScript** defines the behaviour & functionality.

HTML + CSS + JavaScript = Front-end development / client-side

JavaScript was created in 10 days back in 1995, it was created to allow developers to add functionality and interactivity in the browser, some thing that was not quite possible at the time. Since then JavaScript as evolved to be one of the more common programming languages out there. There are very few things that can NOT run JavaScript. The original name for JavaScript was actually LiveScript. JavaScript isn't even the language's actual name. It is over seen by an organization called ECMA (the European Computer Manufacturers Association), and the official name is ECMAScript. More on that later!

## REPL

A REPL (read, eval, print, loop) is an interactive environment where you can type instructions for the computer, which can read, evaluate/run, and print the results of those instructions. The computer then makes itself ready for the next instruction. 

A REPL will take the code you give it and return a result. 

A JavaScript REPL is available in the dev tools of your browser. Open the JavaScript console by navigating to the **console** tab.

Depending on your browser, your console will look slightly different. There should be an an arrow bracket  `>`or `>>` with an input beside it. The cursor should start blinking when you click into the input. Give the computer a simple instruction like `1 + 1`, press enter. The REPL will return a value!

```bash
> 1 + 1
2
```

#### Expressions and values
The instruction that you gave is called an **expression**. What the computer returns is a **value**. In the example above `1 + 1` is the expression and `2` is the value. In the console, the value is returned immediately after you press enter.

**Values** are simply pieces of data (sequences of 0's and 1's).  
An **expression** is any piece of code or instruction given to the computer that produces a value.

Vocabulary is very important because it helps us ask coherent questions and adds structure to our thinking. Just as we learned **selector, rule, property and value** in CSS, go ahead and drill **expression** and **value** into your head now.

## Data Types

Every JavaScript value has a type which determine the role it plays. Listed below are some types you will encounter.

* Numbers — Integers & decimals/floats (e.g. 10, 10.001)
* Strings — characters including spaces.   
 **Must be contained within single or double quotes** (e.g. "Hello" or 'How are you today?')
* Booleans — true or false
* Undefined — means "I don't have a value"
* Null — means "I have a value of nothing"
* Objects — (to be discussed in depth later) **thing to remember even though it'll feel a little confusing at first: everything in JavaScript is an object**
* Symbol (new in ES6, used mostly in library creation, not for general use.)

If you want a mnemonic, some of our instructors like **SNUBONS**.

### typeof

There is a special operator we will look at a bit through out the course of learning called `typeof`. When used with a value it will tell us the type of that value. 

```js
typeof "Heather Payne";
//string

typeof 3792
//number
```
