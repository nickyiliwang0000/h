## Intro to the Internet

### What is the internet?

The internet is the physical infrastructure of connected devices that delivers information from one device to another using wires (electricity), cables (light with fiber optics), and/or radio transmitters (sound waves - wifi!).

Each device has an IP (Internet Protocol) address which is like a telephone number or an street address. Visiting a website is really just asking another computer for information and letting it know where to send that information back to (your IP address).  

But it is difficult to remember the IP address of every website you want to use in a day, so we use the Domain Name System (DNS) to match easy to remember URLs (Uniform Resource Locater) with the IP address of the device where the information we want to access is stored. 

### What is the World Wide Web?

The World Wide Web is one way of viewing information on the internet (other options include email or FTP).  It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.  The ability to "hyperlink" between files made his program stand out. A few short years later, he founded the W3C (or World Wide Web Consortium) to make regulations and recommendations on how the World Wide Web should grow and what technologies should be added.

### What is a website?

It is a collection of files, written in HTML, CSS and Javascript that web browsers can read. To put these files on the internet, we need to host them on a server. A server is really just another computer for which you can pay for the privilege of it never turning off. 

### What is a web browser?

A web browser is the application you use to view website files. Just like Microsoft Word can only read .doc files, web browsers can only read .html, .css and .js files.  Because the W3C cannot force browsers to accept their suggestions, the companies that make these web browsers (Google, Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla) have a lot of control over how the web is works, based on what technologies they implement in their programs. 

### What does a web developer do?

A lot of what we will learn over the next couple months is how to communicate with these web browsers to make them do what we want them to do. Web browsers are always changing: adding new things, making business moves, winning and loosing popularity contests, so being a web developer is synonymous with constantly learning and changing. 

This has been true for the whole history of the World Wide Web. The web is a collection of decisions made over the past few decades by people just like you, for great reasons and not so great reasons. This means sometimes you will have to just memorize how something is and sometimes you get to really understand how things work.  This also means that as you grow as a web developer: making code examples, contributing to open source software, writing how to documents, you get to make the internet too! Use your power wisely, diplomatically and joyfully!


### What does a front-end developer do?

A Front-End Web Developer writes code in HTML, CSS and Javascript. They use compilers and frameworks to make their work flow more efficient. They take design from the designer and the information from a back-end or an API and design and execute the functionality needed to interact with that information.
