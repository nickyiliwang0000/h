In the past, when we've wanted to launch our sites on the web, we have needed to rely on FTP. Not so with Firebase!

## Running the build script
When we are using `create-react-app`, before deploying we will want to run the build script in order to generate a version of our project that is bundled to be optimized for performance. 

To do this, in the root of your React application in the terminal, run `npm run-script build`. When this is complete, there will be a new `/public` folder in your project files. 

Firebase provides us with a **CLI** (command line interface) that will take care of deploying our app for us. The process is simple:

## The Steps
1. Open the terminal, and navigate to your project folder.
2. Install the Firebase Tools: `npm install -g firebase-tools` (If you get an error try running `sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`)
3. Login using 'firebase login` - this should open your browser. Follow the web prompts to continue to log in. You should see something in your command prompt that looks like this: `✔  Success! Logged in as youremail@hackeryou.com`
4. In your project folder, type `firebase init`. This will begin the setup to deploy your Firebase project.
5. Next, it will ask you what Firebase CLI features you want to setup. Use the arrow keys to move down to **hosting**.  note: **Make sure you hit spacebar to select your option before hitting enter - the circle should be filled in!**
6. Next, it will ask you which Firebase project you want to associate as default - pick the name of the Firebase database currently attached to your project. If you're not sure, check your config object inside your app.
7. When it asks you for your directory, specify `build` for create-react-app (or `public` if you are using the HackerYou Gulp/React Boilerplate).
9. For `configure as a single page app`, select 'yes'.
10. It will say that `index.html` already exists, and asks you if you want to overwrite. Select **no**!
11. We're almost done - select `firebase deploy` to launch your app!

```bash
=== Deploying to 'movie-catalogue-6f972'...

✔  database: rules ready to deploy.
i  hosting: preparing ./ directory for upload...
Uploading: [========================================] 99%✔  hosting: ./ folder uploaded successfully

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/movie-catalogue-6f972/overview
Hosting URL: https://movie-catalogue-6f972.firebaseapp.com
```

And that's all there is to it!

For create-react-app: If you want to make updates to your project, once you are ready to re-deploy , run `npm run-script build` again, and then running `firebase deploy`
