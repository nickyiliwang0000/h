## SCSS

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), [Less](http://lesscss.org/) (the dynamic stylesheet language) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) (expressive, dynamic, robust CSS) extend CSS with superpowers! 

But why should I change my CSS workflow? Why make CSS more complicated? Because CSS preprocessors extend the basic functionalities and overcome many limitations of traditional CSS by adding features such as variables, nesting, mixins and many more. These features will actually help to create CSS that is more maintainable, organized and modular.

While each preprocessor language follow similar rules, each has their own syntax different from traditional CSS and must be saved using the file extension associated with each preprocessor language. For Sass, the file extension is `.scss` or `.sass`,  Less uses `.less`and Stylus uses `.styl` .

Because the browser can only read CSS files with the `.css` extension, these special files need to be *compiled* into regular CSS files to be used on the web. 

### Sass

Let's demonstrate the power of pre-processors using Sass. Since Sass is an extension of CSS, note that all regular CSS is also valid Sass! Use as much or as little Sass as you're comfortable with when you're getting started.

There are many tools you can use to get started with Sass. Let's install an application to compile our `.scss` or `.sass` files called [Prepros](https://prepros.io/)

We'll also need to install the *SCSS* package on Sublime. And let's take a second to highlight some of the key features of Prepros.

### Sass Syntax

It's important to know that there are two syntaxes available for Sass. *SCSS* (Sassy CSS) is what we'll be using in these examples. Everything that is valid in CSS is valid in SCSS, which means that you can just write regular CSS in your `.scss` stylesheets and it will be valid - but you can also use some enhanced features that extend the capabilities of regular CSS.

Example: 

```css
ul {
	display: flex;
	background: black;
	li {
		flex: 1 0 auto;
		a {
			display: inline-block;
			padding: 10px;
		}
	}
}
```
The other (older) syntax available uses the `.sass` extension and uses indentation and new lines rather than brackets and semicolons to separate properties. You might find this easier to read and quicker to write - if so by all means use it. 

```sass
ul
	display: flex
	background: black
	li
		flex: 1 0 auto
		a
			display: inline-block
			padding: 10px
```

## SCSS Variables

Variables are used to hold values.  For example, you can specify a colour value to an easy-to-remember variable name and reuse it throughout the stylesheet.

The variable name is set/declared in one place but can be used wherever the value is needed.

Example:

```scss
$primary: #B3EB95;
$secondary: #CCC;
$basefont: "HelveticaNeue-Light", "Helvetica Neue Light", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;

a.myLink {
	background: $primary;
}

p.confirm {
	border: 1px solid $primary;
	color: $secondary;
	font-family: $basefont;
}
```

Variables are incredibly useful to remove any repeated pieces of code. By collecting common styles and assigning them a simple, memorable name you can use quickly, you can cut down production time.

## Nested SCSS

You can nest selectors instead of using long selector names. This keeps your stylesheet organized and saves some space. You can even tack on pseudo selectors in a nested rule using the `&` symbol!

A nested selector represents a child element. This helps to keep our code modular.

**Sass**

```scss
$primary : #B3EB95;

ul.nav {
	background:red;
	width:100%;
	li {
		border-right:1px solid $primary;
		a {
			background:$primary;
			padding:10px;
			&:hover {
				background: yellow;
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Spits out this CSS:

```css
ul.nav {
  background: red;
  width: 100%;
}
ul.nav li {
  border-right: 1px solid #B3EB95;
}
ul.nav li a {
  background: #B3EB95;
  padding: 10px;
}
ul.nav li a:hover {
	background: yellow;
}
```

**The Sass Inception Rule:** "Never nest more than three levels deep." <http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule>

## SCSS Partials

You can break your CSS into organized chunks and they will be stitched together for you. This keeps the CSS organized and more maintainable. 

To create a partial, prepend the file name with a `_`. This will tell the compiler to treat it as a partial and not create a separate CSS file for it

```bash
    _normalize.scss
    _nav.scss
```

To import the partial, use the `@import` keyword, followed by the name of the partial. You do not need to include the underscore or the extension. Sass can figure it all out.

```scss
@import "normalize";
@import "nav";
```

If you have created a separate folder to store the partials, you will have to create the path to the file.

```scss
@import "partials/normalize";
@import "partials/nav";
```

## SCSS Functions

Sass has something called functions which can do some of the hard work for you. Let's take a look at a few:

<http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html>

A couple that you may find particularly useful are the  [`lighten`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#lighten-instance_method) and [`darken`](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html#darken-instance_method) functions. They creates a lighter or darker version of any colour. 
 
 ```scss
$primary : #B3EB95

a.myLink {
  background:$primary;
  &:hover {
  	background: lighten($primary, 10) //10% lighter than $primary;
  }
  &:visited {
  	background: darken($primary, 10) //10% darker than $primary;
  }
}
```

## SCSS Extend

Remember the DRY rule? It stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." Sass can help you with this through the use of the extend feature. With extend, you can efficiently tell selectors to inherit styles from another selector. 

Let's take a look at a use case:
	
```scss
//Assign styles to a selector

.banner{
	background: hotpink;
	padding: 20px;
	font-style: italic;

}

//use extend to pass these styles onto another selector

.crazy-banner{
	@extend .banner;
	border: 3px dashed #bada55;	
}
```

This will result in the following output 
```scss

.banner, .crazy-banner{
	background: hotpink;
	padding: 20px;
	font-style: italic;
}

.crazy-banner{
	border: 3px dashed #bada55;
}
```

Instead of repeating the properties in both selectors, Sass will *comma separate* the original selector. 

## SCSS Mixins


Mixins are a powerful tool to use when we want to repeat similar chunks of code, but with slight variations. We can create mixins that allow arguments to be passed in to modify their output, making them dynamic. 

```scss
@mixin fontSize($sizeValue) {
	font-size: $sizeValue;
	color: blue;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```
Within the mixin, we use the placeholder variable to apply what the value is to CSS property we need. When the mixin is called within a selector, we pass in an 'argument' with the value we need, and that value is supplied in the place of the placeholder variable.	

```scss
h1 {
	@include fontSize(36px);
}

p {
	@include fontSize(14px);
}
```

Compiles to
```css
h1 {
	font-size: 36px;
	color: blue;
	font-weight: bold;
}

p {
	font-size: 14px;
	color: blue;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

We can even get Sass to do math for us! Say we want it to dymanimcally generate our font sizes in rems with a pixel fallback. So far, we have been setting the base font size in our html to 62.5% to allow for easy rem calculation. Here's how we might make it even easier with a mixin:

```scss
@mixin fontSize($sizeValue){
	font-size: $sizeValue * 1px;
	font-size: ($sizeValue/10) * 1rem;
}

h1{
	@include fontSize(48);
}
```

Compiles to

```css
h1{
	font-size: 48px;
	font-size: 4.8rem;
}
```

### Positioning Mixin

```scss
@mixin position($type, $top, $right, $bottom, $left) { 
	position: $type; 
	top: $top; 
	right: $right; 
	bottom: $bottom; 
	left: $left; 
}
.box { 
	@include position(absolute, 10px, 10px, 5px 10px); 
}
```

## SCSS Gotchas

* How do we link our background images inside of our SCSS files?


## Using SCSS

The idea of sass is that you will write your styles in `style.scss` which will then compile into a `style.css` file. The browser doesn't understand sass, so it needs to be compiled to regular CSS before that.

This CSS file is what you want to link to your HTML. If you link to your SCSS file, the styles **will not** load.

![](http://cl.ly/image/1W0E2w1l1j3q/compiling-scss.png)

Instead of compiling it on every save manually, it is much easier to use a tool that will watch your SCSS file for changes and automatically compile into CSS for you. 

We recommend using Sass with the [Prepros app](https://prepros.io/), which is available for both Windows and Mac. You should have already downloaded Prepros, but if you haven't, go ahead and do that!

Create a new folder with the following structure.

```bash
- index.html
styles/
	- style.scss
```

Drag this new folder into Prepros and it will automatically be watched. When we save the `style.scss` file, a compiled `style.css` file will be created.
