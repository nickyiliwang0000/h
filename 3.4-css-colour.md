# Intro to CSS Colours

Colour is an important part of styling. Choosing the right format for colour can help acheive the look you (or your designer) wants.

> In CSS, the color property is spelled `color`, not `colour` because CSS was created in the US. **¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯**

There are six different formats that can be used as a ~~colour~~ color value for a property.
- CSS color keyword
- Hexadecimal
- RGB
- RGBA
- HSL
- HSLA

## CSS color keywords 
There are 16 basic color keywords in CSS and 131 extended color keywords. Any color keyword can be given as a value to a property that accepts colour.

The 16 basic keywords:
- black
- silver
- gray
- white
- maroon
- red
- purple
- fuchsia
- green
- lime
- olive
- yellow
- navy
- blue
- teal
- aqua

A selected list of the extended ones:
- crimson
- peachpuff
- dodgerblue
- orchid
- rebeccapurple

## Hexadecmial color

A common way to provide color is to use the _hexadecimal_ system. The codes or values produced by this system are sets of alphanumeric characters prepended by a `#`.

Some common colors are:
| color name | hex value |
| ---: | --- |
| black | #000000 |
| white| #ffffff |
| red| #ff0000 |
| green| #00ff00 |
| blue| #0000ff |

Hex codes are made up of three pairs of alphanumeric digits that represent red, green, and blue respectively. The characters that can be used range from 0-9 and a-f, `0` represents the absence of color (black) and `f` represents all the colours combined (white). Hex codes are not case-sensitive.

**Black**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00  |  00 | 00  |

**White**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| ff  |  ff | ff  |

**Red**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| ff  |  00 | 00  |

**Green**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00 |  ff | 00  |

**Blue**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00 |  00 | ff  |

### Shorthand

Hex values can be shortened into three digits if the two digits that represent each RGB value are the same. So when you use colours where there are three pairs, you can abbreviate each color channel using one character instead of two identical characters.

**Examples**

- `#000000` = `#000`
- `#ffffff` = `#fff`
- `#994499` = `#949`
- `#dd1122` = `#d12`

### RGB/RGBA

Providing color in an RGB format will be familiar to designers. While it is similar to hex codes in that you supply RGB values, it provides additional support for alpha (opacity) channels if needed.

To declare a color in RGB, pass in a value between 0 and 255 for each color respectively, and separate with a comma.

**Black**

`rgb(0,0,0)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 0 |  0 | 0  |

**White**

`rgb(255,255,255)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 255 |  255 | 255  |

**Red**

`rgb(255,0,0)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 255 |  0 | 0  |

**Blue**

`rgb(0,0,255)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 0 |  0 | 255  |

**Limegreen**

`rgb(50,205,50)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 50 |  205 | 50  |

#### Alpha

To use a color with a transparency, use the color format of `rgba`. Pass in the same RGB values as before, but include a fourth option representing the level of alpha transparency. This number is a decimal between 0 and 1.

**Black with 50% alpha**

`rgba(0,0,0, 0.5)`

| r  | g  | b | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 0 |  0 | 0  | 0.5 |

**Tomato with 30% alpha**

`rgba(255,99,71, 0.3)`

| r  | g  | b | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 255 |  99 | 71  | 0.3 |


### Opacity

Wait, there's totally a property called **opacity** out there. Why don't we use this? Well, if we apply opacity to an element, all the children of that element will inherit the opacity. Let's try this out. 

```html 
<header>
	<h1>Disappearing Act</h1>
	<p>Going, going, gone</p>
</header>
```

Let's see what this looks like without opacity: 

```css 
header {
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	background-color: darkcyan;
}
```

Let's add in opacity 0.5 or 50% and see what it looks like:

```css 
header {
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	background-color: darkcyan;
	opacity: 0.5;
}
```

![Opacity 0.5](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-28%20at%204.21.07%20PM.png)

Notice how the text has inherited the 50% opacity value? This problem can be completely avoided if we use a rgba background color to get that transparent look.

```css
header {
	width: 400px;
	min-height: 200px;
	margin: 50px auto;
	background-color: rgba(0, 139, 139, 0.5);
}
```

## CSS Color - HSLA

Similar to RGB/RGBA, HSL(A) is a format that offers further flexibility for colors. The format allows a color to be defined through a 'hue', the 'saturation' of the hue, and the 'lightness'.

**An HSL Color Wheel**

![HSL Colour Wheel](https://uwdigipub.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hsl-color-wheel-pagespeed-ce-if6-exzipy.png)

The 'hue' value is a representation of the rotation around a color wheel. The 'saturation' value is how much color is applied (0% = grayscale). The 'lightness' value is how light or dark the color is from 0 to 100%, (where 0 is black, and 100% is white, and the average lightness value is 50%). The 'alpha' value is the amount of transparency.

**Black**

`hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 1)`

| h  | s  | l | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 0 |  0% | 0%  | 1 |

**Skyblue with 30% alpha**

`hsla(197, 71%, 73%, 0.3)`

| h  | s  | l | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 197 |  71% | 73%  | 0.3 |

## CMYK vs. RGB vs. HSL

There are two sets of color keywords in the CSS3 spec that refer to the same color.  Cyan and aqua are the same and magenta and fuchsia are the same.

Why? Well. Get ready.

Printed or dyed color is different from digital color. We perceive printed or dyed color when light reflects off physical matter. Digital color is made from light. This is why different kinds of screens render color a little differently.

		![](http://www.mobiliodevelopment.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RGB-colors.gif)
* RBG color model
	* Screens (historically computer screens) use the red-blue-green color model. 
	* RBG is additive, which means that the starting point is black (the absence of light) and the opposite end of the spectrum white light (i.e. the combination of red, green, and blue lights)

![HSL Colour Wheel](https://uwdigipub.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hsl-color-wheel-pagespeed-ce-if6-exzipy.png)

* HSL color model
 * Screens (historically TV screens) use the hue-saturation-light model.
 * HSL is additive, like RBG. The `hue` value is a representation of the location around the color wheel. The `saturation` value is how much color is applied (0% = grayscale). The `lightness` value is how illuminated the color is where 0 is black, 100% is white, and the average lightness value is 50%.
 * The [appeal of HSL is](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS3/Color/HSL) that changing the numbers changes the color [in a way you would expect](https://css-tricks.com/examples/HSLaExplorer/). 

HSL is newer than RBG and was created in part as a color model that explicitly takes into account the way colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision. 

* CMYK color model
	* Print uses the cyan-magenta-yellow-black model. CMYK (the K is for blac**k**)
	* CMYK is subtractive, which means that the starting point is black (all the colors together) and the opposite end of the spectrum is white (i.e. color of the paper).

Most (but not all) colors from RGB can be represented using CMYK. This makes sense; you can make more and finer-grained distinctions with light than with ink.

In each of those models, you can get that <span style="background-color:cyan;">bright blue color</span>.  In RBG, it's in the middle of green and blue and white light and it's called aqua. In CMYK, it's a cardinal color called cyan. We look at color on screens, but our names for the colors come from real life. So having both as CSS color keywords comes from developers having different frames of reference for the colors they're creating on the web.
