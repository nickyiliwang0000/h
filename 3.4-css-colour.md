## Intro to CSS Colours

In styling and CSS, colour is a very important component. It can be used as the colour of text and as the background of elements. Choosing the correct format of colour can help to provide additional styling features.

In CSS, the color property is spelled `color`, not `colour`. **CSS was created in the US. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯**

There are 6 different formats that can be used to supply ~~colour~~ color to a property.

 - Name
 - Hex Value
 - RGB
 - RGBA
 - HSL
 - HSLA

## CSS Color - Name

In CSS, you can provide a simple color name as a property. These colors have been defined within the system and can be used when a direct tone is required.

For basic colors, you can use their names directly:
- red
- blue
- green
- black
- white
- pink

For more creative colors, specific names have been assigned
- crimson
- peachpuff
- dodgerblue
- orchid
- rebeccapurple

## CSS Color - Hex

A common way to provide color is to use hex codes. These are sets of alphanumeric characters prepended by a `#`.

Some common colors are:
- black: #000000
- white: #ffffff
- red: #ff0000
- green: #00ff00
- blue: #0000ff

Hex codes are made up of three pairs of alphanumeric digits that represent red, green and blue respectively. The characters that can be used range from 0-9 and a-f, '0' representing the absence of color (black) and 'f' representing full color (white).

_Note: The characters provided can be in either upper or lower case._

**Black**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00  |  00 | 00  |

**White**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| ff  |  ff | ff  |

**Red**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| ff  |  00 | 00  |

**Green**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00 |  ff | 00  |

**Blue**

| r  | g  |  b |
|---|---|---|
| 00 |  00 | ff  |

#### Shorthand

Hex values can be shortened into three digits if the two digits that represent each RGB value are the same. So when you use colors where there are three pairs, you can abbreviate each color channel using one character instead of two identical characters.

**Examples**

- `#000000` = `#000`
- `#ffffff` = `#fff`
- `#994499` = `#949`
- `#dd1122` = `#d12`

### RGB/RGBA

Providing color in an RGB format will be familiar to designers. While it is similar to hex codes in that you supply RGB values, it provides additional support for alpha (opacity) channels if needed.

To declare a color in RGB, pass in a value between 0 and 255 for each color respectively, and separate with a comma.

**Black**

`rgb(0,0,0)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 0 |  0 | 0  |

**White**

`rgb(255,255,255)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 255 |  255 | 255  |

**Red**

`rgb(255,0,0)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 255 |  0 | 0  |

**Blue**

`rgb(0,0,255)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 0 |  0 | 255  |

**Limegreen**

`rgb(50,205,50)`

| r  | g  | b |
|---|---|---|
| 50 |  205 | 50  |

#### Alpha

To use a color with a transparency, use the color format of `rgba`. Pass in the same RGB values as before, but include a fourth option representing the level of alpha transparency. This number is a decimal between 0 and 1.

**Black with 50% alpha**

`rgba(0,0,0, 0.5)`

| r  | g  | b | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 0 |  0 | 0  | 0.5 |

**Tomato with 30% alpha**

`rgba(255,99,71, 0.3)`

| r  | g  | b | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 255 |  99 | 71  | 0.3 |


### Opacity

Wait, there's totally a property called **opacity** out there. Why don't we use this? Well, if we apply opacity to an element, all the children of that element will inherit the opacity. Let's try this out. 

```html 
<header>
	<h1>Disappearing Act</h1>
	<p>Going, going, gone</p>
</header>
```

Let's see what this looks like without opacity: 

```css 
header {
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	background-color: darkcyan;
}
```

Let's add in opacity 0.5 or 50% and see what it looks like:

```css 
header {
	width: 500px;
	height: 500px;
	background-color: darkcyan;
	opacity: 0.5;
}
```

![Opacity 0.5](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/Screen%20Shot%202016-09-28%20at%204.21.07%20PM.png)

Notice how the text has inherited the 50% opacity value? This problem can be completely avoided if we use a rgba background color to get that transparent look.

```css
header {
	width: 400px;
	min-height: 200px;
	margin: 50px auto;
	background-color: rgba(0, 139, 139, 0.5);
}
```

## CSS Color - HSLA

Similar to RGB/RGBA, HSL(A) is a format that offers further flexibility for colors. The format allows a color to be defined through a 'hue', the 'saturation' of the hue, and the 'lightness'.

**An HSL Color Wheel**

![HSL Colour Wheel](https://uwdigipub.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/hsl-color-wheel-pagespeed-ce-if6-exzipy.png)

The 'hue' value is a representation of the rotation around a color wheel. The 'saturation' value is how much color is applied (0% = grayscale). The 'lightness' value is how light or dark the color is from 0 to 100%, (where 0 is black, and 100% is white, and the average lightness value is 50%). The 'alpha' value is the amount of transparency.

**Black**

`hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 1)`

| h  | s  | l | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 0 |  0% | 0%  | 1 |

**Skyblue with 30% alpha**

`hsla(197, 71%, 73%, 0.3)`

| h  | s  | l | a |
|---|---|---|--|
| 197 |  71% | 73%  | 0.3 |
