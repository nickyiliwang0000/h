# Advanced layouts
## Percentage-based layout

When using floats to lay out a page, we need to ensure that the sum of the widths of floated elements is less than or equal to the width of the parent container so that the children can sit next to each other.

If the parent's width is, say, 800px, the childrens' widths can't add up to more than 800px, otherwise the children will break on to separate lines. This math can get tedious, so instead of using exact pixel sizes for our floated child elements, let's use percentage values.

Open [advanced-layouts-starter.html](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/advanced-layouts-starter.html) and changes the pixels sizes of the floated child elementsto percentages.

### Container elements

You'll notice that in all of our layout examples, we have a surrounding element that acts as our parent element. This element has a pixel size and `margin: 0 auto` applied.

We've usually given this element a class of `.wrapper` (this is an arbitrary name). The wrapper serves as a way to constrain our content while allowing the background to cover the entire browser window.

If we don't have a wrapper,  `width: 50%;` will be 50% of the browser window. This can get messy because there are many different sized devices available. 50% of a 14" Acer Swift is different than 50% of a 27" iMac Pro. And what happens when a user scales their browser? When working with layouts and designs, it's important to think beyond the dimensions of your own devices. Remember that **100% is a relative value.**

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
	width: 1280px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

section {
	width: 65%;
	float: left;
}

aside {
	width: 35%;
	float: left;
}
```

In the above example, we can see that the `section` element is 65% of the parent element. Knowing that the parent element is 1280px, we can conclude that the section will render at 832px wide.

### `max-width`

If we've set a width on our wrapper to 1280px, what happens when the viewport is less than 1280px wide? The browser will still render an element that is 1280px with scroll bars to see the hidden parts of it.

To combat this problem, we can replace the `width` property on the wrapper with a `max-width` property.

```css
.wrapper {
	max-width: 1280px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

`max-width` allows the element to resize for smaller devices. The element will be 100% of it's parent element **until** it reaches 1280px, and then it will stop growing. 

The opposite of `max-width` is `min-width`, a property that specifies the smallest possible size for an element.

The corresponding `max-height` and `min-height` properties are less used but can be useful when working with dynamic content.

Moving forward, it's best practice to include a `max-width` property with a pixel value on your containing element (i.e. wrapper) when you use percentages for floated child elements.

## Using the viewport to size content

The viewport is the current size of the viewable content area of your browser. The viewport does not include the address or bookmarks bar; it is the entire area within which HTML is rendered.

The size of the viewport is different everywhere. Viewport width is a relative value that changes with every user's device, and when the user drags the browser window. 

Web experiences often feature full browser header images or content that is relative to the size of the user's browser. Imagine how difficult it would be to ensure that an element fit 100% of the viewport on every screen. In the past, we used JavaScript to measure the size of the window once all the content was loaded, and resize the elements accordingly.

We discussed standard CSS measurement units in 3.5 CSS measurement units, but there are a couple more recent additions to the dimension discussion: we can use the viewport to size our elements. `vw` and `vh` units allow us to measure the user's viewport in CSS without the need for JavaScript. These units measure the width of the viewport and return a relative value. These units are [not fully supported in legacy browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=view) but can be very handy.

### `vh`

This one measures viewport height. Think of it as a percentage: the full height of the viewport is 100%.

> **100% = 100vh**

### `vw`

This one's viewport width. You may find that you will not use this as often as other units, but it is indeed useful for larger challenges. Typically, percentage values should be used as it refers to the parent element.
