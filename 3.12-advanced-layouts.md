## Percentage Based Layout

When using floats in layouts, we need to ensure that the sum of the widths of floated elements is less than or equal to 100% of the parent container. 

For example, two elements that are inside of an element that is 800px wide cannot have a sum that exceeds 800px, or the elements won't appear next to each other.

This requires us to do a bit of math every time we want to create a layout, ensuring we have the exact pixel size for the sum of all objects.

Instead of using exact pixel sizes for our floated child elements, we can use percentage values. This way we only need to make sure the elements add up to 100% of their parent container.

Let's revisit <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/twoColumns.html" class="exercise" download>twoColumns.html</a> and use percentages for the floated child elements instead of pixel sizes.

You'll notice that in all of the examples for layouts, there has been a surrounding element that has acted as our parent element. This element has a pixel size and `margin: 0 auto` applied.

This 'wrapper'* element serves as a way to contain our elements, ensuring they don't expand too far on the screen. By setting a width on the wrapper, we use that as our '100%' limit to size our inner elements with.

<small>*the class name is arbitrary, it can be named anything you'd like.</small>

If we don't have a parent element with a fixed width to surround our content, saying `width: 50%;` will be 50% of the users window. This can get messy, because there are many different sized devices available. 50% of a 14" Acer Swift is different than 50% of a 27" iMac Pro.

When working with layouts and designs, it's important to think beyond the dimensions of your own devices. 100% is a relative value. 


```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
	width: 1280px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

section {
	width: 65%;
	float: left;
}

aside {
	width: 35%;
	float: left;
}
```

In the above example, we can see that the `section` element is 65% of the parent element. Knowing that the parent element is 1280px, we can conclude that the section is 832px wide.

## max-width

When working with dimensions, what happens if the device is smaller than 1280px, like an iPhone or a tablet? The page will still render an element on the page that is 1280px and use scroll bars in the browser to view the rest of the element.

To combat this problem, we can replace the `width` property on the wrapper with a `max-width` property.

```css
.wrapper {
	max-width: 1280px;
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

This allows the element to resize for smaller devices. The element will be 100% of it's parent element **until** it reaches 1280px, and then stop growing. This acts like a fluid layout.

Moving forward, it's best practice to include max-widths on wrappers and percentages for child elements as it will benefit our workflow greatly when working with responsive layouts.

#### Max and Min

Just like max-width, there is conversely a `min-width` property what will never let an element be smaller than a set value.

As well, there are `max-height` and `min-height` properties that can be useful when working with dynamic content.

## Calc

### Mixing pixels with Percentages

Now that we understand how to limit the sizing and see the benefits of using percentages with our elements, what if we want to put some space between our elements.

Open up <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/calcLayout.html" class="exercise" download>calcLayout.html</a> to follow along.

In previous examples, we had to ensure that the widths of child elements added up to the same width of the parent container. 

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
	.wrapper {
		max-width: 800px;
	}

	section {
		float: left;
		width: 500px;
	}

	aside {
		float: left;
		width: 300px;
	}
</style>
```

However if we used margin to provide spacing between our elements, we would have to account for that amount of margin as well within our elements.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
	.wrapper {
		max-width: 800px;
	}

	section {
		float: left;
		width: 480px;
		margin: 0 10px;
	}

	aside {
		float: left;
		width: 280px;
		margin: 0 10px;
	}
</style>
```

Now if we were using percentages, we could easily account change the units, but 10% of a container is quite a big size for a margin.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
	.wrapper {
		max-width: 800px;
	}

	section {
		float: left;
		width: 45%;
		margin: 0 10%;
	}

	aside {
		float: left;
		width: 15%;
		margin: 0 10%;
	}
</style>
```

So instead of working with unknown percentages, why don't we work with percentages for widths and pixels for margins, something more tangible.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
	.wrapper {
		max-width: 800px;
	}

	section {
		float: left;
		width: 65%;
		margin: 0 10px;
	}

	aside {
		float: left;
		width: 35%;
		margin: 0 10px;
	}
</style>
```

So 10px +10px = 20px. 65% - 20px = ?

This is where it gets tricky, Percentages are relative values and because we're using a fluid layout, we would have to do the math every time we wanted to size the screen.

#### CSS Calculations

Luckily there is a CSS tool that allows us to resize things accordingly. We can utilize a tool called `calc()` that will do the math for us. We provide `calc()` as a value for a property and pass in the equation we want to be evaluated between the parentheses.

```css
section {
	width: calc(65% - 20px);
}
```
<em>Note that calc() is whitespace sensitive, `calc(65%-20px)` will not work. Make sure to add spaces `calc(65% - 20px)`.</em>

Currently, `calc()` is pretty well supported across different browsers and will become part of our CSS toolkit moving forward. [To see the current support of calc() click here](https://caniuse.com/#search=calc()).  

So using `calc()`, we can now mix percentages and pixels to create a layout that is fluid and looks great.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<section></section>
	<aside></aside>
</div>

<style>
	.wrapper {
		max-width: 800px;
	}

	section {
		float: left;
		width: calc(65% - 20px);
		margin: 0 10px;
	}

	aside {
		float: left;
		width: calc(35% - 20px);
		margin: 0 10px;
	}
</style>
```

## Viewport Units

### Using the Viewport to measure

Along with the units we've explored, there are some more recent additions to the dimension discussion: we can use the viewport to size our elements.

#### What is the viewport? The viewport is the current size of the viewable content area of your browser. The viewport does not include the address or bookmarks bar, it is the entire area that the HTML renders within.

<img src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/viewport.png" alt="viewport">

Now, the size of the viewport is different everywhere. It is a relative value that changes with every user's device. Imagine the size of the viewport on an 11" MacBook Air versus a 17" Alienware R5, it's very different.

Often web experiences feature full browser header images or content that is relative to the size of the user's browser. If you imagine how difficult it would be to ensure something fits 100% of the viewport, on every screen you'd see how being able to measure the viewport would be useful for our designs.

In the past, to measure these values we would have to use JavaScript to measure the size of the window ONCE all the content was loaded, and resize the elements accordingly.

Luckily new dimensional units have been introduced in the recent years that allow us to measure the user's viewport directly in our CSS without the need for JavaScript. Be aware though, the units are [not fully supported in legacy browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=view).

#### Viewport Units - `vh` and `vw`

**vh**

The viewport height. This measures the height of the user's viewport and returns a relative value. Think of it as a percentage, the full height of the viewport is 100%

**100% = 100vh**

<img src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/viewportVH.png" alt="">

Example - 100% height of the user's viewport

```css
header {
	height: 100vh;
}
```

Example - Margin always 20% from the top of the user's viewport

```css
nav {
	margin-top: 20vh;
}
```

**vw**

The viewport width. Measures the width of the viewport and returns a relative value. You may find that you will not use this as often as other units, but it is indeed useful for larger challenges. Typically, percentage values should be used as it refers to the parent element.

<img src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/viewportVW.png" alt="">

Example - Moving an element based on screen width

```css
section {
	margin-right: 10vw;
}
```

## Full Bleed Layouts

A current trend in web design is a full bleed layout. What this means is that sections of the website appear to take up the full width of the screen.

While the background expands to the edges of the browser, the content is contained and centered. Remember, we want to think outside of our own browser when we create websites.

So, instead of containing all of our our content in a single wrapper, we put the content wrapper **inside** of each element.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
    <header>
        <h1>This is the Title</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>this is a paragraph</p>
    </section>
    <footer>
        <p>This is the footer</p>
    </footer>
</div>
```

now becomes

```html
<header>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <h1>This is the Title</h1>
    </div>
</header>
<section>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>this is a paragraph</p>
    </div>
</section>
<footer>
    <div class="wrapper">
        <p>This is the footer</p>
    </div>
</footer>
```
