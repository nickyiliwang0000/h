## Structure With HTML Elements

### Div
The HTML *document division* element is a generic element used to define an area of content. Content in web page designs is visually broken up into chunks that sometimes don't correspond to the elements available to developers. The `<div></div>` element can be used to wrap other content elements and make them available to styling as a group.

```html
<div>
	<h1>I'm the header</h1>
	<p>Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue laoreet rutrum faucibus dolor auctor.</p>
</div>
```

#### div or span?!!?!?!
This is a big source of confusion — when do we use `div` and when do we use `span`? What's the difference?

The technical difference between the two is that `div` is a block element and `span` is an inline element. Now these probably don't mean much to you right now, so let's take a look at the previous example using divs instead of spans:

```html
<p>My favourite foods are <div class="food">broccoli</div>, <div class="food">goat roti</div> and <div class="food">eggs</div></p>
```

<p>My favourite foods are <div class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">broccoli</div>, <div class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">goat roti</div> and <div class='food' style="background:red; color:#fff;">eggs</div></p>

Why does each item break on to a new line? Because `div` is a block element, which means it should not be used **in a line** or **inline**.

In general, spans go inside other elements — such as `<p>` or `<h2>` — so we can later specifically target that bit of content. `div`s are used to wrap larger sections of content together.

## Semantic Elements

Before HTML5, a group of HTML elements could be wrapped in div with an id or a class which was targeted to style that content. This can lead to confusion on a page because it can be difficult to tell which element does what. **Semantics elements**, introduced in HTML5, are used to define the role some content plays on a website.

#### HTML5 Elements
HTML5 introduced new elements that describe what part of the page they represent. Instead of using `<div class="header"></div>`, you can use the `<header></header>` element along with a class for specific styling.

#### Some HTML5 elements
`header` : Defines the header of a page or a section. It often contains the title of a page, and a tagline/subtitle.

```html
<header>
  <h1>Page Title!</h1>
</header>
```

`footer` : Defines the footer of a page or a section. It can sometimes contain information about the page, such as who wrote/developed it, copyright information and sometimes links to related files/documents.

```html
<footer>
  <p>Copyright 2014</p>
</footer>
```

`main` : Used for the main content of your page. It should only be used once within your document.

```html
<main class="content">
  <p>Content Goes Here</p>
</main>
```

`nav`: Defines a section that contains links to other parts of your website. Pssttt... You can have more than one `nav` on your web page. 

```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="home.html">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="page.html">Page</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

`section`: Defines a section in a document. The elements nested inside of a `section` often share a similar theme. Use an ID or a class to add styling.

```html
<section class="about">
  <h2>About our class</h2>
  <p>Related information goes here</p>
  <p>We're cool humans learning to code.</p>
</section>
<section class="skills">
  <h2>Skills</2>
  <p>We know HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Fun</p>
</section>
```

`article` : Defines a complete and independent piece of content on your site. For example, it's typically used for a post in a blog, a news article or individual comment.

```html
<article>
  <p>Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Donec sed odio dui.</p>
</article>
```

`aside`: Defines a section of content that is secondary to the main content. Often used as a sidebar.

```html
<aside>
  <p>Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Donec sed odio dui.</p>
</aside>
```

`figure`: Specifies an image, code chunk, illustration, or a diagram. Sometimes it may have `img`, `code` or `video` and `figcaption` elements nested inside of it. Figures are also self containing. Ideally, figures can be moved to a different part of the page without affecting the flow of content.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="mysweetpicture.jpg">
</figure>
```

`figcaption`: Defines a caption for the figure item. There should only be one figcaption nested inside of a figure (not all figures need a figcaption). Figcaption can be included before or after the contained element.
```html
<figure>
  <figcaption>My cool headshot</figcaption>
  <img src="mysweetpicture.jpg">
</figure>
```

That's a lot of semantic elements to remember!

#### When do you use a `div` and when do I use a semantic element? 

Remember that the point of a semantic element is to make meaning for the browser and us humans. When none of the semantic elements make sense to use, choose a `div`. Often, `div`s are used to group elements that will be styled together (more on this when start learning about CSS).
