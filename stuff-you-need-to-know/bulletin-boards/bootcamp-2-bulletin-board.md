# This is your cohort's bulletin board!

## Here is where we will post the weekly schedule, review topics for texts, and anything else we need you to know


<!-- ### Daily Schedule

_ALL TIMES ARE ESTIMATES FOR YOUR CONVIENICE AND AWARENESS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE_

We would like you to have a detailed a schedule to refer to now that we are online. However, we need to be super flexible with timing to allow for lessons to be extra juicy when YOU want them to be. **Never worry** if the real life timing isn't matching this estimate. We will adjust as needed and make sure the content gets covered and that you get the time you need for projects.  -->
