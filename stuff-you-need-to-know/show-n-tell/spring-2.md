# Show 'n' Tell

Let’s get to know each other and practice public speaking a bit! Below you'll find some preliminary instructions on how to prep for your Show & Tell week, the date you'll be presenting, and what to include in your presentation!  You're welcome to choose anything that you’re excited about as a topic - we want presentations to be lighthearted, uplifting, motivational, and/or informative! It could be personal or professional, code related or not, serious or funny, so long as it’s something you care about!
 **Please DM Olga on slack to have your topic approved!** 

We'll have a practice session, usually **Thursday at 5pm** during the week of your presentation so you can make sure you feel prepared to present! Don't worry you'll receive a reminder on Monday! Don't feel pressured to have a completed, polished presentation ready, you can run through whatever you have! We'll talk about the logistics of the presentations (who’s sharing when and how), have everyone do a timed runthrough and you'll get some some notes and advice before the big day!

## The How:
You'll each be presenting on your topic for *3 minutes*. Your topics don't have to be related - you're presenting individually, not as a group, so don't worry about coordinating! 

You definitely do not have to be an expert on the subject just tell us what you’re passionate about!

You can create a slide deck, a simple website, just have props in your video feed instead of sharing your screen, or something else entirely! Your presentations can all be unique - it’s about getting to know you after all!

Feel free to choose your topic at any time in the Bootcamp, you don’t have to wait until the week you’re presenting.

## The Why:
Presenting and public speaking is a surprisingly present part of being a web developer! In the workplace you may have to do regular demos of your work, you may speak directly to clients, you’ll have to show your work to your leads, etc. Even in the interview process, you may be asked to present some of your work! Practicing this skill, especially as we all get used to the new online tools and methods of our current climate, will be super important!

As a bonus, we’ll all get to learn a bit more about each of you and have a nice end to the week with your cohort mates! Show & Tell is a fun, chill opportunity to teach your friends a little something and practice these skills! It's low stakes so don't feel too pressured or spend too much time making your presentation! 

## The When:
Submit your topic **to Olga by EOD Wednesday of your presentation week**. You can claim or pitch a topic *ANY* time throughout the Bootcamp so feel free to prepare early once your topic is approved!

Class/Project work time stops at 5pm on Fridays - Show & Tell starts with your presentations at ~5pm

## The Who:
Your Show & Tell groups have been assigned by week. You can find the list of groups [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nNtc4s0M6aWJv1K_sNPYzFOXappNFq9LZYzwl4B9JQg/edit?usp=sharing)

Happy presenting!
