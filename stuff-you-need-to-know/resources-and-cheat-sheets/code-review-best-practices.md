# Code Review Best Practices

## What is a Code Review?

When one developer finishes work on an issue, component, or project, another developer - or team of developers - looks over the code. Code reviews are commonplace industry-wide and all developers will at some point, if not constantly, have their code undergo a review. Code reviews are classless, meaning that even the most senior developers will undergo review by their peers, often by more junior developers. You can think of it like marking and studying a paper at the same time!

## Why do we Code Review?

Code reviews are not just about offering feedback on someone else's code, but are also a chance to learn from it. Code reviews provide an opportunity to share knowledge! In a workplace, code reviews will give developers a chance to get to know sections of a code-base that they themselves might not otherwise see. It can also give more junior developers a chance to read through a more senior developers code to learn from it! Code reviews can act a way to encourage collaboration and mentorship across teams and individuals.
