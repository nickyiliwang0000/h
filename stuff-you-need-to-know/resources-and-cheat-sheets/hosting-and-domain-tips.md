# Hosting and domain name tips

* Don't buy a domain name before you've got your Twitter and your GitHub set up! 
  - It's nice but not necessary to have them all be the same thing.

* Be aware of what you're buying: many sites offer a cheap first purchase and much higher subsequent ones (and they auto-renew!)

* Hosting usually costs between $2 and $20 a month. 
  - You do not need a hosting plan that has a 1-touch WordPress install / dedicated WordPress hosting.
  - Shared hosting (also sometimes called shared server) is a-ok!
  - The smallest hosting plan is usually plenty.
  - You do not need very much storage. 10GB should be more than enough.
  - It is a good idea to get an SSL certificate. It's security. This means your site's URL will be `https` instead of `http`.
  - You want access to the cPanel.
  - 24/7 or well-reviewed support is ideal.
  - The hosting company should be in our time zone.
  - Email is nice to have but you don't need it.

* A domain name should cost about $15 for a year. 


* Hosting and a domain name together should cost **at most** $100/year.
  - Plan on buying for a year; many devs take down their personal sites once they've been working for a while, but you'll need yours for at least 3 months if not 6.

* It is easiest to buy a domain and hosting together. If you're worried, choose a hosting provider that provides a domain name. 
  - If the idea of pointing your domain to your host sounds like a fun challenge, buy them separately.
