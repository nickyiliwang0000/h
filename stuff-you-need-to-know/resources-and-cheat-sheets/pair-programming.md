# Pair Programming

## 1. Driver and Navigator Roles

#### Driver
The Driver is the one responsible for type.

#### Navigator
The Navigator is resposible for dictating what we should type. 

This is what we call the 'Strong Technique' in pair programming. Literally, if the driver suddenly has an idea about how the rest of the program should go they say "Ooo! I have an idea! You take over typing!" And then they explain their idea to the new Driver to put into code.

## 2. Decide on workflow

#### Switch Often

Every 25 mins or so (you can decide if longer or shorter works for your team), you should switch roles. Be sure to decide how long the time period is going to be and set a timer at the beginning of your coding session.

#### Take Breaks

Pair programming can be more exhausting than solo coding depending on your working style so make sure you are building in breaks to your working time. Perhaps every time you both get a turn to drive for 25mins then you take a longer break. Decide on this ahead of time. 

#### Communicate about what your work hours will be

Make sure you talk to your partner early in the process about what time of day and week it is best for you to work. Do you have other commitments that you need to work around? Does your brain shut off at 9:00pm? Set expectations about working arrangements at the beginning of the partnership.

## 3. Allow time to recharge

Allow time for introverts to recharge while getting work done by splitting up some small well-defined tasks at the end of a day of pair programming. Make sure you continue to communicate about what you are working on.
