# HelpCue best practices

HelpCue is a tool that helps us distribute instructor support in a fair way. You can use it to ask for one-on-one help from instructors during project work time. You can enter a question or a problem and instructors will help you in the order the questions were asked. In addition to making sure everyone gets the help they need, HelpCue will also give you the opportunity to explain technical issues to other developers.

## When is HelpCue available?
HelpCue will be open during project work time, which you can expect throughout the week. We will also be using HelpCue during fishbowls. 

> Check the [bootcamp calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=hackeryou.com_ckj6930nr6kraakaisos09cccs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto) for fishbowl dates.  

We ask that you do not add questions when HelpCue is closed. We will be deleting questions that were added outside of HelpCue hours to keep things fair.

### HelpCue is closed...
* Monday to Friday from 1:00pm to 2:00pm for lunch
* at 5:30pm Monday to Thursdays
* at 4:40pm on Fridays for show and tell
* during daily breaks
* Friday mornings from 10:00am to 11:30am

## HelpCue etiquette
### What to do before asking your question...
1. Reflect! Ask yourself what are you trying to do. What do you know so far? Has the browser provided any errors?
2. Try solving it on your own first. Is there something in the Juno notes that might help? Have you googled the problem and tried some of the suggestions? Read the documentation!
3. Think of how you can word this issue to someone who doesn’t know as much about on what you’re currently working on.

## Question template

"I am having trouble with _____, I am sitting ______ wearing _____. I've tried _______ and _____."

## Examples of good and bad HelpCue questions
### Good questions
_“I’m having trouble resolving a 400 error that I'm getting back from the API. I've checked the network tab and tried a couple of stackoverflow suggestions. I’m sitting in the main classroom in the second row!”_

_"I'm trying to get two items to overlap with one another using positioning, but things are flying out of view when I resize the browser. I've googled it, read a blog post, but I'm still stuck. Sitting in the community space. Wearing a blue t-shirt"_

_"I'm hoping someone could walk me through map() and filter() again. I've read the notes and I'm still kind of confused. Sitting by the grey couches close to the fishbowl."_

### Bad questions
_“My app broke! Help!”_

_"I have a scrolling issue, by the couches"_

_"My styles aren't applying"_

### Why should we care about asking good questions?
* Instructors will know how to better support you in solving your problem
* As a junior developer, you will have to seek help from senior developers and this will give you an opportunity to practice communicating technical problems to other people
* Instructors will be able to speak to your awesome communication and problem skills on the queue when potential employers ask us about you!

## General HelpCue best practices
* One question at a time
* Don't add questions when HelpCue is closed! We will delete any questions that were added! :(
* Add your location - it will help instructors figure out where you are in the space
* Use #design for design help
* Do not ask for a specific instructor by name
* HelpCue is for bootcamp projects, exercises and concepts, not for freelance projects, show & tell prep, or other non-curriculum stuff
* Try googling it first and don’t be afraid to break something! It's just code!
* Try a hard refresh

## What you can expect
* Instructors will provide less guidance in HelpCue as the weeks progress
* Instead of walking you through each step, instructors may give you some suggestions to try on your own
* For the group projects, we want you to rely more on your teammates 
* HelpCue won’t be available when you are working at your first development job!
* We want you to have confidence in solving problems on your own post-bootcamp

## Signs that it's time for HelpCue
* You’ve googled the problem and none of the relevant solutions are working
* You’ve gone over our class notes
* You’ve gone over any relevant documentation
* **OR** you’ve been working on it for 45mins or more!

## Do your best
In addition to building great projects, we want you to be able to articulate problems and explain code to other people. HelpCue is just an opportunity for you to practice these skills. Don't be afraid to use HelpCue. Ultimately, we are here for you and we want to help you!
