### Feedback from the mock tech test
> Using pseudocode and your own thoughts, describe your thought process of how you would create a masonry-style gallery like the one below using floats, NOT using flexbox,or grids.

🎉 Successes 🎉 
- 🎨bunch of people drew over the image to help explain their ideas. FANTASTIC!

- Great job remembering the importance of setup/reset snippets and wrappers.

- LOTS of talk about the clearfix class when floating elements.

- A couple people mentioned the role of responsiveness. We should always be thinking about this.

🔨 Things to think about 🔨

A couple of y’all wrote actual HTML/CSS code. Always make sure to read your instructions carefully. Pseudo code shouldn’t have any actual code in it! Remember, with pseudo code we are essentially trying to help organize our thoughts and break down our process into small digestible steps to solve a problem. A Technical interviewer will be looking for your ability to explain technical concepts, not just write the rules to achieve it.

Great work 🤙
