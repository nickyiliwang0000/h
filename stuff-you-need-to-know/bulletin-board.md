### Mock Test Feedback
> Write 1-2 sentences explaining what a map function does AND write 4-10 lines of pseudo code that break down each step.

They key here is to highlight the essential components that make up `.map()`:
* .map() is an array method
* .map() invokes a callback function for each index in the provided array
* .map() returns a new array
* .map() does not mutate the original array


🎉 Successes 🎉
* At least three of the aforementioned details were consistently highlighted in your responses 👍This demonstrates a really strong understanding of this method!

* Everyones pseudo code has improved so so much over the course of these tests! 

🔨 Things to work on 🔨
* Even though you pseudo code has improved, continue to work on it! It will be an ongoing process to effectively communicate your code logic in short but precise statements.

* Vocabulary like 'iterates', 'executes, 'outputs' and 'returns' are helpful when explaining programming concepts.
