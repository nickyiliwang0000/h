### General feedback from the mock tech test

> Given the array below, how would you create a new array that holds **only** the names of the beaches with pictures?

ðŸŽ‰ Successes ðŸŽ‰
* Lots of people know for loop syntax by heart. Woo!
* A couple people drew on the data to highlight what they _expected_ to get back. That's great! Know your data, know which ones you expect to get back, so you don't get a false positive for your filtering condition. (e.g. both beaches, or `Tyrell beach` and `Lowell forest`)
* Lots of people couldn't remember the syntax for what they wanted to do (totally okay!), but could explain the method they wanted and what it did (excellent!). 
* Lots of saying you're use `const` for the new array, which is great, because you don't have a reason for it to be a `let`.
* Lots of people correctly mentioning that `map` returns an array.

ðŸ”¨ Things to work on ðŸ”¨
* If you only wrote code and you're not 1000000% sure your code works, **write some pseudo code**!
* A lot of people wrote code that returned `['Tyrell beach', 'Lowell forest']`, which would have been fine if all the locations were beaches. But they were not.
* A couple people mentioned jQuery, but remember: `map`, `filter`, and `forEach` (and `reduce`) are now native JS methods! 


The most concise way to solve this this problem is with `.filter()` **and** `.map()`:
```js
const locations = [
  {name:'Tyrell beach',
  type:'beach',
  img:'images/tyrellBeach.png'
  },
  {name:'Mo\'okai beach',
  type:'beach',
  },
  {name:'Lowell forest',
  type:'forest',
  img:'images/lowellForest.png'
  }
]

const beachesWithPicture = locations.filter(location =>{
  return location.type === 'beach' && location.img
}).map(beach =>{
  return beach.name
});
```

A more readable version breaks the return from the `.map` out into its own variable:
```js
const beachesWithPicture = locations.filter(location =>{
  return location.type === 'beach' && location.img
});

const beachNames = beachesWithPicture.map(beach =>{
  return beach.name
});
```

You could also use `.forEach`:
```js
const beachNames =[];

const beachesWithPicture = locations.forEach(location =>{
  if(location.type === 'beach' && location.img){
    beachNames.push(location.name)
  }
});

const beachNames = beachesWithPicture.map(beach =>{
  return beach.name
});
```

You could also use a `for` loop:
```js
const beachNames =[];
for(let i=0;i<locations.length;i++){
  if(locations[i].img && locations[i].type === 'beach'){
    beachNames.push(locations[i].name)
  }
}
```

Less preferred would be nested `if` statements inside that `for` loop:
```js
const beachNames =[];

for(let i=0;i<locations.length;i++){
  if (locations[i].img) {
    if(locations[i].type === 'beach'){
      beachNames.push(locations[i].name);
    }
  }
}

```
