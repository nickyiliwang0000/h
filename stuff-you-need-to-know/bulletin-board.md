### General feedback from the mock tech test
> What is a React component? How does a simple component differ from a complex one?

The word "component" is used to refer to the subclasses (complex components), functions (simple components), JS files (e.g. Header.js), and JSX tags (e.g. <PetList ). It its core, a component is an [independent, reusable piece](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html) of code.

`Component` is a class that React has built for us. We can create extensions of that class (i.e. subclasses) using the `class ______ extends Component` statement. Inside this extended class, we must use the `render` method and **can** use the other lifecycle methods if we want. These extended classes are called complex (or stateful) components. They have state if we declare it inside the `constructor` function.

Simple components are not extended from a class. They are functions that return JSX. 

ðŸŽ‰ Successes ðŸŽ‰
* Many people were able to describe a component in many different (all accurate) ways!
* People did a great job of saying "I'm not sure, but I think..."

ðŸ”¨ Things to work on ðŸ”¨
* Lots of fuzzy language - practice your React vocabulary! Explaining things is a great way to clarify your own understanding.
* Some people only answered half of the question. ðŸŒ—
