### Mock Test Feedback
> What is a React Component? How does a Function component differ from a Class component?

The major takeaways we are looking for are:

What is a React Component:
* React components are either a function or ES6 class that lets you optionally render a piece of UI (a view)
* Components are independent and reusable blocks of code

Function Component:
* Can be referred to as presentational or stateless component
* A regular JS object that can render JSX and can accept props as an argument
* Function components do not have access to state or lifecycle methods

Class Component:
* Can be referred to as a stateful component
* Class components are ES6 classes that extends the React Component class
* Class components have access to state and component lifecycle methods


üéâ Successes üéâ
* Y‚Äôall are talking like React developers.ü§ìGreat use and understanding of the library and JS terminology

üî® Things to work on üî®
* Keep reading questions carefully. Answers should have defined what a react component is, what a function component is, and what a class component is.


* While everyone was able to correctly note a function component‚Äôs inability to access state, a lot of people left out their inability to access lifecycle methods as well. This is a very important distinction between the two


* There was some mention of the create-react-app infrastructure (App.js). While this is definitely helpful for your understanding, that environment is unique to create-react-app and not all React projects will use it or have a component named App.js
