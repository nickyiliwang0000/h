## Webfonts

Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/web-fonts.html" download>web-fonts.html</a> to follow along.

**What happens when we want to use a font that isn't installed on someone's computer?**

Previously we were held back to using font stacks that were 'websafe', which means a good percentage of users would have at least one of them installed. This was a bummer because we had a list of fonts about 10 long, all of which were fairly boring. When we wanted to use nice fonts, we would have to save the graphic in photoshop and export it as an image.

No longer! In the past few years CSS3 has allowed us to use something called **web fonts** which lets us embed a file that magically makes custom fonts available.

There are various ways to embed **web fonts** including the paid <a href="http://typekit.com" target="_blank">typekit</a>, but we will be using the super easy and free option of <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a>

#### Embedding a custom Google web font
Doing so is fairly easy:

1. Head on over to <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a> and track down a font you like
1. Click the "plus" icon for **quick use** <br>

1. Choose the weights that you wish to use

    * Note that the more fonts and the more weights you add to a page, the slower your page will load. As rule of thumb, try not to include more that 3-4 fonts/weights in production code.
1. Some fonts have extended charter sets available if your website will be in a language such as Russian or Vietnamese.

1. In the next step, click the "standard tab" if it isn't already selected and copy the code provided.

6. Paste that line of code into the `<head>` of your document
7. You can now use the value of the font name in your `font-family` stack, just as you would any other font. Google will recommend a good font-stack for you to use.

    * You may want to apply it to all text on the body:
        * `body { font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; }`
    * Or just your headers:
        * `h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 { font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; }`

#### Trying it yourself

Go ahead and pick a few fonts that you like from Google Web Fonts and embed them into a new HTML file. Write some markup and content, and using CSS selectors, apply your new fonts.

### What font is ____ using?

Now that you're aware of the different types of typography properties available, you will start viewing websites in a whole new way. You'll often see beautiful type treatments on websites and wonder what font they used.

A great tool to view the font used is <a href="http://www.typesample.com/" target="_blank">Type Sample</a>. By installing the Chrome Extension, you can turn it on and select fonts on a page to view more information about its styling.
