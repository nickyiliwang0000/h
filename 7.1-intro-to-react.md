# Intro to React

React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces and single page applications.

A single page application (SPA) is a kind of website that loads a single HTML file and uses AJAX to update it without needing to update the page. You've already built some SPAs - your API projects.

The React library powers tons of websites on the internet, including [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com) and [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com/).

### Installing the React Devtools
