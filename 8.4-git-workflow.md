### Branch Workflow Setup

This is a sample git workflow for your own repos that uses a test branch to stage all updates. All major additions or updates get their own feature branch, which only get merged into test branch.  The test branch is staging area to test and preview all your changes.  When everything is good on test, test gets merged into master.

#### Create a new test branch
The command `git checkout -b test` creates a new trackable branch. `git push origin test` sends this branch to GitHub. Let's go into our `index.html` and add a title to our project. `<h1>This is my project!</h1>`.

#### Create a new feature branch

`git checkout -b myfeaturebranch` creates a new trackable branch called `myfeaturebranch` where you'll write some code that creates a feature for your website. For now let's just add a script tag where that feature will go. In the `index.html`, add a set of `<script></script>`tags.

### Working on a feature branch

When you're on your feature branch, `git pull origin master` will grab the changes from your `test` master branch and add them to your feature branch so you can begin work using the most recent code.

#### If you need to switch to another branch before you're ready to commit
`git stash`  will put away the current changes on your branch for later so you can go do stuff in another branch (`git checkout test` to take you to the `test` branch) without having to commit these changes.
`git checkout myfeaturebranch` will bring you back to your feature branch.
`git stash apply` will bring back what you put away on this feature branch.

#### When you're ready to commit your changes
`git add -A` will add all untracked and changed files.
`git commit -m "this is what I did"` Commits your changes with your commit message.
`git push origin myfeaturebranch` Will push your changes to the `myfeaturebranch` repo on GitHub.  

### Merging your feature into test and then master

#### Merge feature branch changes into test branch

If you're in your `myfeaturebranch`, use `git checkout test` to switch to your `test` branch.
`git pull origin master` makes sure you're up to date with the latest from master. 
`git merge myfeaturebranch`merges your feature branch into the `test` branch.
`git commit origin test`  Commits your merge  
`git push origin test` Pushes your merge to the test repo on GitHub.
Then, test your site on staging server (or in test branch)	to see if your changes jive with what's already there.

#### Merge test into master
From `myfeaturebranch`, `git checkout master` will switch you back to master. 
`git merge test`  will merge in your feature branch.
`git commit origin master`  will commit your merge.
`git push origin master` will send your merge to GitHub.   

#### (Optional) Delete the feature branch if you don't need to come back to it
If you're in your feature branch, use `git checkout master` to go somewhere that's not the branch you want to delete.
Use `git push origin :myfeaturebranch`  to delete the myfeaturebranch branch on GitHub (upstream). 
`git branch -d myfeaturebranch` will delete the branch on your computer.
