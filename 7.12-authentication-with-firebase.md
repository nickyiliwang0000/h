Twitter, Facebook, even Slack - all of these applications have one thing in common: they all employ authentication.

Using your e-mail and password, you create an account, log in, and enjoy a personalized experience interacting with that application. From a technical standpoint, this movement through the application is often called the *authentication flow* or simply, authentication.

### How we used to do it
In the past, authentication was tricky. It required understanding how databases work, more advanced computer science concepts like tokenization, and a solid understanding of a back-end programming language like PHP or Ruby.

### How we can do it now
Firebase offers us a suite of authentication tools we can use to store our user information in their databases. Using Firebase's authentication toolkit, we'll be learning how to:

* Create a user with e-mail and address
* Allow the user to sign in
* Allow the user to log out
* Allow the user's session to persist (a.k.a. for them to remain logged in even after the page refreshes, or they navigate away and come back)

Let's dive in!

## Setting up a simple application
We're going to create a simple application that allows you to create a user, and allows that user to log in and log out. We are intentionally keeping this as straightforward as possible so that it will be easier to integrate into your existing applications.

### Setup
1. Let's start by creating a new React project: `create-react-app [nameofproject]`. NPM install `firebase` as well by running `npm install firebase`
2. In the Firebase dashboard, create a new project. Call it `firebase-react-authentication`. Click on the 'Authentication' tab, and then click 'Set Sign-Up Method'. Toggle the enable Google authentication and click save.

3. Grab the initialization code and add it to your `app.js`. It should look something like this:


```javascript
// app.js
import firebase from firebase;

var config = {
  apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
  authDomain: "fir-react-authentication.firebaseapp.com",
  databaseURL: "https://fir-react-authentication.firebaseio.com",
  storageBucket: "fir-react-authentication.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "179937455676"
};
firebase.initializeApp(config);
```

### Writing our First Component
4. Now let's set up our first component:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
```

We're going to user Google as our authentication provider for this project, primarily because it will make handling our authentication flow very simple: we won't have to worry about things like error handling and password validation since Google will take care of all of that for us. We also won't have to build any UI components (other than a login and logout button) to handle auth. Everything will be managed through a popup.

In past versions of our firebase apps, we've configured them so anyone can read and write to the database. We're going to change this so that only users that are signed in can write to the database. Change your rules so that it looks like this, and hit Publish:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
```

These rules tell Firebase to only allow users who are authenticated to read and write from the database.


First we are going to create an instance of the Google provider object as well as an instance of the auth module from firebase:
```javascript
const provider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
const auth = firebase.auth();
```

Now, inside your App's constructor, let's start by carving out a space in our initial state that will hold all of our signed in user's information.

```javascript
constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      user: null
    }
```

Let's set up some buttons to render conditionally whether or not a user is logged in our out.

```javascript
 render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header><h1>Authy App</h1>{this.state.user ? <button onClick={this.logout}>Log Out</button> : <button onClick={this.login}>Login</button>}</header>     
      </div>
    );
  }
```

If the value of user is truthy, then it means that the user is currently logged in and should see the logout button. If the value of user is null, it means that the user is currently logged out and should see the log in button.

The `onClick` of each of these buttons will point to two functions that we will create on the component itself in just a second: login and logout .

Now, we can set up the login method to handle our google authentication. 

```javascript
login = () => {
  auth.signInWithPopup(provider) 
    .then((result) => {
      const user = result.user;
      this.setState({
        user
      });
    });
}
```

`signInWithPopup` has a promise API that allows us to call `.then` on it and pass in a callback. This callback will be provided with a result object that contains, among other things, a property called `.user` that has all the information about the user who has just successfully signed in - including their name and user photo. We then store this inside of the state using setState.

Try signing in and then checking the React DevTools - you'll see the user there!

The logout method is incredibly straightforward. After the login method inside your component, add the following method:

```javascript
logout  = () => {
  auth.signOut()
    .then(() => {
      this.setState({
        user: null
      });
    });
}
```

### Persisting Login Across Refresh

As of right now, every time you refresh the page, your application forgets that you were already logged in, which is a bit of a bummer. But Firebase has an event listener, `onAuthStateChange`, that can actually check every single time the app loads to see if the user was already signed in last time they visited your app. If they were, you can automatically sign them back in.

We'll do this inside of our componentDidMount, which is meant for these kinds of side affects:

```javascript
componentDidMount() {
  auth.onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    if (user) {
      this.setState({ user });
    } 
  });
```
When the user signs in, this checks the Firebase database to see if they were already previously authenticated. If they were, we set their user details back into the state.

Now, we can update the ui to reflect that the user has been logged in!
