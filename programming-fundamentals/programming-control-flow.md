# Programming control flow

Normally, instructions (i.e. **statements**) in a JavaScript are executed one after the other in the order in which they are written. 

The term _control flow_ describes how a developer might choose to order the statements, regardless of the order in which they appear in the JavaScript file.

An example of control flow is an `if` statement:
```js
if (time === 22) {
   goToSleep();
} else {
  learnMoreCode();
}
```
In this statment block, the `goToSleep()` function is only executed if the variable `time` is 22 (i.e. ten o'clock at night), even though it appears in the script before `learnMoreCode`.

Let's dive into that logic!

## Conditional statements

The statement block above is a _conditional statement_, meaning that a  condition needs to be satisfied in order to run each function.

Here is the syntax for if/else statements:

```js
if (condition) {
  // block statement (do something)
} else {
  // block statement (do something)
}
```
Some vocabulary:
* `if` and `else` are keywords
* `condition` will usually be an expression that evaluates to a boolean 
* `block statement` will be a chunk of code

> Note that the whole `else` block is **optional**! If you don't include an `else` block and the condition isn't met, the block statement after the `if` gets ignored.

### Comparison operators
The first step in using an if/else statement is defining up the condition. A condition is a JavaScript expression that evaluates to a boolean (e.g. `true` or `false`). How do we evaluate the pieces of an expression? Using _comparison operators_.

Operator     |  Description  
------------ | -------------
`==` | is equal to 
`===` | is exactly equal to (value and type)
`!=`| is not equal to
`!==`| is strictly not equal to
`>`| greater than 
`<`| less than
`>=`| greater than or equal to	
`<=`| less than or equal to

Create two variables and compare them using the `===` and `!==` operators. Compare the variables with `>=` and `<=` and then again with `>` and `<`.

**Exercise**: In the console, write two expressions that return the boolean value `false` and two that return `true`.

**Why don't we use `=` to compare values?**
> Because `=` is what we use to reassign variables.

### Logical operators
We use logical operators to make more complex conditions.

Operators | Description
---|---
`&&` | and
`||` | or
`!`  | not

We can combine boolean expressions using (`&&`) and (`||`) operators.

Most often you will use `&&` to determine if two statements are **both** true, for example:

```js
const cow = "mammal";
const feet = 4;

cow === "mammal" && feet > 2 // returns true, since cows are mammals AND they have more than two feet

cow === "mammal" && feet > 6 // returns false, because even though cows are mammals, they have fewer than 6 feet!
```

Most often you will use `||` in situations where at least **one** of the conditions **must** be true:
```js
const age = 30;
const hasParentalPermission = true;

age > 18 || hasParentalPermission === true
```

This will return true if EITHER the `age` variable is greater than 18 OR the `hasParentalPermission` variable is equal to `true`.

The only time an `||` will return false is if NEITHER condition is true. So if `age` is less than 18, **AND** `hasParentalPermission` is not equal to `true`, this statement will return `false`.

#### A fun gotcha!
Any value in JavaScript can be compared to any other value in JavaScript, even when the comparison doesn't make sense:
```js
//is this boolean larger than this string?
true > 'something'
//false

// is this number smaller than undefined?
0 < undefined
// false

// is this number roughly equal true?
1 == true
// true
```

Data type  | Value
---|---
`null` | `false`
`undefined` | `false`
any `string`| `true`
the `number` 0 | `false`
any `number` higher than 0 |`true`

Data types and values that evaluate to false (i.e. `0`,`null`, and `undefined`) are known as _falsy_, whereas data types and values that evaluate to true (i.e. strings, any number higher than 0) are known as _truthy_. This is why the `===` operator exists: it checks for equality in both type **and** value; `==` checks for equality **only** in value.

```js
let num = 0;
if ('string' && num === 0){
    console.log('the string evaluates to true')
  } else {
    console.log('the string evaluates to false')
  }
// this statement will be true!
```

### Block statements
A _block_ is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly brackets `{}`:

```js
if ( time === 'morning') {
   // do all of the following things
   console.log("Good morning!");
} else {
  // do all the following things if the first condition is false
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

In fact a block statement could be just the `{}`.

```js
{
  console.log('Hi!');
}
```

## Loops
Another powerful concept in programming is _looping_. A loop runs a block of statements are repeatedly while a condition is true.

![A diagram that describes the flow of a loop](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/loops.png)

### `for` loops
This is the syntax for a `for` loop:

```js
for (initialExpression; condition; incrementExpression) {
  // loop statements
}
```
Some vocabulary:
* The intial expression is typically used to initialize a counter variable.
  * This expression can also declare variables using the `let` keyword.
* As in an `if` statement, the condition is an expression that is evaluated to a boolean. 
  * The expression is evaluated before each loop iteration. 
  * If it evaluates to true, the statement is executed. 
  * If it evaluates to false, the `for` loop ends.
* The increment expression generally describes how the counter variable should change at the end of each loop. 
  * It usually adds `1` to the variable.

Predict what this `for` loop will produce:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
> This `for` loop will print the numbers 0-9 to the console.

When would you use a `for` loop? 

Let's say you have a music playlist containing 10 songs. You want the playlist to queue up the songs. The `for` loop may look something like this:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
  queueNextSong(i);
}
```

The intial expression `let i = 0;` starts with the index of the first song.   
The condition `i < 10` is evaluated to see if it is tue that the index of the song that is queued is less than 10. If true, there are more songs to queue up. If false, the loop will return.
The increment expression `i = i + 1` tells the variable `i` to increase by 1 to to move to the index of the next song.

### `while` loops
A while looks is very similar to a `for` loop, but with even less information:
```js
while (condition) {
   // block statement
}
```
The block executes repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨  D A N G E R  A L E R T ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

If the condition is never false, loop will keep forever and your browser will crash. This is called an _infinite loop_. If you do get an infinite loop, quit your browser with `ctrl + Q` or `cmd + Q`. Sometimes Firefox will give you a little yellow tooltip that asks if you want to quit the process. You do!

If you can't quit from the browser, go to your 'Activity Monitor', select the browser in question, and force it to quit.

On PC, `ctrl + shift + esc` will bring up the Task Manager. Choose your browser and click 'End Task'.

Let's look at an example of a non-infinite `while` loop:

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i = i + 1;
}
```

When `i === 9` the block executes one final time, 9 is printed and `i` is incremented to 10. The block doesn't execute anymore because the condition is false. However, the value from the last executed expression is returned (that's why `10` has a little arrow beside it).

## The `break` keyword

We can terminate a loop at any time by using a _break statement_:
```js
let number = 23;
while (true) {
  number = number + 1
  if (number % 9 === 0) {
    break;
  }
}
```
The above example **would** be an infinite loop (because `true` is always true!) **but** the break statement terminates the loop when the number is divisible by 9. 

The returned value (27) is greater than 23 and divisible by 9.
