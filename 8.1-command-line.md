As developers, we write in many different languages and have lots of exciting products at our disposal. For presentational work, we can use classic CSS, or a newer styling language like Sass or Less. For interactions, we can write regular (sometimes called *vanilla*) JavaScript or  use packages of pre-written JavaScript code in the form of frameworks or libraries.

One of the most powerful tools in our arsenal, however, is tucked away inside the system folder on our computer. It's the low-level interface of our computers which we call the **command line**,  and it can greatly improve our workflow.


### Why should a front-end developer learn to use the command line?

Front-end developers in particular and computer users in general often use visual tools to perform programming tasks. This makes plenty of sense: if we need to change the color of a button, it's easier to pick a color from a drop-down than it is to create a CSS file, link it, and write a declaration with a hex code. Inside these tools the computer's running commands. Often, we're limited in which actions we can perform due to the design of the tool.

The command line gives us full control over our system, and unlocks super powers for our projects.

### Opening the command line

To open the command line, we can either use the pre-installed command line tool on Windows and Mac, or we can install our own (which allows for even more control over our computers).

#### Mac

To open an instance of the command line on a Mac, we can use the 'Terminal' application. To open up the app, open up your `Applications` folder, navigate to the `Utilities` directory and open up the Terminal app.

If you want to have more control over your command line, we recommend you install [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com/).

#### Windows

To open an instance of the command line in Windows, click the 'Start' button, choose 'All Programs', navigate to 'Accessories' and choose 'Command Prompt'.

However, we recommend installing a tool called [cmder](http://cmder.net/) and using that moving forward, because Command Prompt does not allow as much flexibility with the file system as cmder does.

If you have Windows 10 you could also install the [Ubuntu Bash](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

### FUN FACT

The name `bash` is a joke because it's a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) based on an [older shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) written by a person named Stephen Bourne. This *new* shell is a Bo(u)rn(e) Again SHell a.k.a. BASH a.k.a. bash. (This is why memes caught on so fast: low bar for Internet humor.)
