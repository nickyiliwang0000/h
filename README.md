#These are the new + improved HY Bootcamp notes!

The naming convention is number-name. 

  **1.3-meet-your-text-editor**

If the file gets combined with another one or the order changes, preface the file with NB-

  **NB-1.3-meet-your-text-editor**

Files prefaced with NB- might not live in the current Bootcamp template but _will_ have a corresponding slot in the new Bootcamp template.

Naming convention to follow.
