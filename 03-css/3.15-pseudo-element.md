## Before and After Elements

We have already learned that we have pseudo selectors: `:hover`, `:focus` etc..

We also have  `::before` and `::after` - they are what we call 'pseudo elements', secondary elements on every element that can be used for stylistic purposes. The syntax officially requires the use of `::`, but many browsers will accept the use of a single colon, `:before` and `:after`.  

These are added in CSS and create elements before or after that can be used to add stylistic/cosmetic touches like smart quotes, or borders that can be different sizes than the content.

In order to use Before/After elements, the `content` property must be supplied to the selector. This property outlines the content that will be inserted either before or after the content in the main element.

Note: pseudo elements cannot be added to self-closing elements such as images and inputs.

```html
<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

<style>
   .name::before {
        content : '☃';  
    }
</style>
```


<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

<style>
   .name::before {
        content : '☃';  
    }
</style>

A very common use case for `::before` and `::after` is to add “smart quotes” around a blockquote.

Let's walk through an example of how to use before and after with a blockquote. We want to wrap our blockquotes in "“”".

## Making shapes
One of the uses of before/after elements is to make shapes that were previously impossible. By using borders with before/after elements, we can create hexagons.
