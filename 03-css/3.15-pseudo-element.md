## Before and After Elements

We have already learned that we have pseudo selectors: `:hover`, `:focus` etc..

We also have  `::before` and `::after` - they are what we call 'pseudo elements', secondary elements that can be used for stylistic purposes. The syntax officially requires the use of `::`, but many browsers will accept the use of a single colon, `:before` and `:after`.  

These are added in CSS and create elements before or after that can be used to add stylistic/cosmetic touches like smart quotes, or borders that can be different sizes than the content.

In order to use Before/After elements, the `content` property must be supplied to the selector. This property outlines the content that will be inserted either before or after the content in the main element.

Note: pseudo elements cannot be added to self-closing elements such as images and inputs.

```html
<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

<style>
   .name::before {
      content : '☃';  
    }
</style>
```

<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

A very common use case for `::before` and `::after` is to add “smart quotes” around a blockquote.

Let's walk through an example of how to use before and after with a blockquote. We want to wrap our blockquotes in "“”".

### Pseudo elements and accessibility
Elements that we create using `::before` and `::after` are examples of CSS generated content. Since they are inserted into our web pages through CSS, they are not accessible to all assistive devices. We should avoid using pseudo elements to create content that would be important to our web page.

## Making shapes
We can also create decorative shapes using pseudo elements. Often times, these shapes do not have any content. In order for us to create a pseudo element we wil still need to include the content property and provide it with empty quotes as the value.

```html
<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

<style>
   .name::before {
      content : '';
			width: 5px;
			height: 5px;
			border-radius: 50%;  
			background: tomato;
    }
</style>
```

Something important for us to know about pseudo elements, is that they are inline elements. In order for a pseudo element without content to be visible, it needs to be set to something other than `display: inline`. 

```html
<span class="name">Cool Person</span>

<style>
   .name::before {
      content : '';
			width: 5px;
			height: 5px;
			border-radius: 50%;  
			background: tomato;
			display: block;
    }
</style>
```

Changing the example above to `display: block`, allows the pseudo element to accept the height and width specified and therefore visible.

We can also make more complex shapes using pseudo elements. Check out these additional resources on how to make your own shapes:
