## Domains and hosting

We at HackerYou are all about promoting your online presence. Every developer needs a website to host their portfolio and a bit about them. 

When purchasing your website, it's important to understand the two main components of owning a website.

### Hosting

Hosting refers to the actual server that holds the files your website is comprised of. Servers can be located anywhere in the world and hold millions of other users files.

Each server has a DNS address for example, `120.120.01.01`, that can be reached via the browser.

When a website is 'live', that means that files have been moved from a users computer onto the hosting server.

### Domain names
Since accessing servers via long numbers like `120.120.01.01` is difficult, domain names are used as friendlier options that point to the long addresses.

For example, when you visit 'http://hackeryou.com' in your browser, the domain name is mapped to the numbered server address.

Domain names can be purchased together with hosting, or separately. When purchased separately, you need to point your DNS (Domain Name Servers) from your domain registrar to your hosting company. In these cases, you will need to ask your **hosting** company for which name servers to use (ns1.bluehost.com, ns2.bluehost.com), and change accordingly in your domain registrar's settings. If this is the case, reach out to the domain and hosting companies support, or an instructor.

**To learn more about how your browser connects to a website**, check out this cute but informative comic, [How DNS Works](https://howdns.works)! Also here is a great comic on how [HTTPS works](https://howhttps.works/) as well!

## FTP

FTP stands for _file transfer protocol_. It allows us to connect to a server and upload files to it.

There are many many ways to deploy your files to a web server, for example rails developers may use something called Capistrano or use Heroku deployment tools. However, FTP is the simplest and most common for developers like yourself.

To connect to FTP, we need a FTP client. You may have a favourite FTP client already, and you are welcome to use it. These are the most popular and do more than enough.

**Mac and Windows:** FileZilla [http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client](http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client)

**Mac:** Transmit [http://panic.com/transmit/](http://panic.com/transmit/)

### FTP username and password
If you already have a FTP username and password, you can skip this step.

Log into your hosting account and click FTP accounts: ![Yellow diamond icon representing FTP accounts page on hosting interface](http://wes.io/L96O/content)

Go ahead and enter the information as so. Make sure the directory is set to `public_html` and not a sub directory.

Put your username and password somewhere safe. If you use a password manager, I **highly** recommend putting your username and password in there now.

## Configuring FileZilla

Click the blue and green 'Site Manager' icon in the top left corner ![Site manager icon below the window's exit and minimize buttons](http://f.cl.ly/items/0i0K3B0S1e273V2u0M0S/Screen%20Shot%202014-01-22%20at%201.25.49%20PM.png) then click "New Site" to enter your credentials:

* Rename "New Site" to whatever you like
* Host is **ftp.yourdomainname.com**
* Leave Port, Protocol as is.
* Change Encryption to 'Only use plain FTP (insecure)'
* Set Logon Type to **Normal**
* User is whatever you just set plus **@yourdomainname.com** (ex: wesbos@hackeryou.com )
* Password is whatever you just set

Go ahead and click connect, you should connect to your server.

FileZilla will now show a listing of all the files on your **local** machine (left hand side) and all the files in the **root** directory of your **remote** webserver (right hand side). 

You can navigate around the files and directories on both sides like in Explorer or Finder. To upload to the server, drag and drop from the left side to the right.

The server works just like your computer, upload an **index.html** and surf to www.yourdomain.com and you will see it. Note that with some server configurations, you'll need to place your files in the  `public_html` directory. 

Similarly, you can upload a folder called `finalproject` and surf to `www.yourdomain.com/finalproject` to see it.

A best practice is to edit your website locally (on your computer) until you are happy with your progress. Then drag and drop the entire folders contents onto your server.
