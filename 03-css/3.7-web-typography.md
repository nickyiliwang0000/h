## Intro to CSS Typography

Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/typography.html" download>typography.html</a> so we can follow along.

Having good CSS Typography is one of the best ways to make your site look amazing. With CSS we have complete control over how our text looks and feels. We will spend the next while going through some of the available properties to style your text, but first, let's review a few different ways we can mark up text:

#### Headings

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

#### Paragraphs, spans, strong and emphasis

```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</p>

<p>Hey there my name is <strong>HackerYou</strong> and I <em>really</em> like to code HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>My birthday party is on <span class="date">February 18</span>, please come with presents!</p>
```

## Font-Family

The browser default font for typographical elements is typically a serif font such as 'Times New Roman'.

To change the font family that an element will use, we can use the `font-family` property.

With CSS we can set the font with the **font family name**:

```css
body {
	font-family: 'Helvetica';
}
```

Or a **generic name**:

```css
body {
	font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

The difference being that with a font family, you assume/hope the end user has that specific font on their computer. With a **Generic name** you let the browser/computer supply the best font. In the case of `sans-serif` a windows computer will deliver **Arial** while a mac will deliver **Helvetica**.

Available Generic names are:

* 'serif' (e.g., Times)
* 'sans-serif' (e.g., Helvetica)
* 'cursive' (e.g., Zapf-Chancery)
* 'fantasy' (e.g., Western)
* 'monospace' (e.g., Courier)

### Font Stacks
What if a user doesn't have the font you declared, installed on their computer? What will the font turn to?

Let's say we have a special font called `Montserrat` that I have downloaded and installed and then wrote the code below:

```css
body {
	font-family: 'Montserrat';
}
```

When I view the page, the font looks great, but if anyone else who doesn't have the font installed they won't see it and **the browser defaults to times new roman** (or another serif font).

That's kind of crappy, so to prevent that we use **font stacks** which allows us to supply a list of desired fonts for the browser to fallback on:

```css
body {
	font-family:'lobster','wedding',cursive;
}
```

The code above checks for lobster, if it isn't found, it checks for 'wedding', if that isn't found, we go to the default cursive font for that computer.

An excellent resource for building your fail-proof font stacks is <a href="http://cssfontstack.com/" target="_blank">http://cssfontstack.com/</a>. Let's take a look.

## Font-Size

Next up is font-size. This one is pretty self-explanatory and something we've used before. We are going to be working with pixels for sizing our fonts.

If you set the font-size on the `body`, it is inherited by all the `<p>` tags on the page:

```css
body {
	font-size:15px;
}
```

If we then want to target just the second paragraph with the class of `text2`, we can overide that last rule with the following:

```css
p.text2 {
	font-size:20px;
}
```

#### Working with relative values

Often within a webpage, we want to set a base font size and size our elements relative to that value. For that purpose, we can use the `REM` (Root EM) unit to size our fonts.

First of all, we select the HTML element and set a font-size in pixels on that.

```css
html {
	font-size: 10px;
}
```

Now whenever we want to declare a font size to be used somewhere, we use a REM value which is a multiple of the base size.

**2REM = 20px**

**2.5REM = 25px**

```css
h1 {
	font-size: 2.5rem;
}
```

While REMs can seem like a lot of work, they are extremely useful in larger and more advanced projects. If a larger font size is needed throughout, only one value needs to be changed and all the others react in relation.

You'll often see the root font size set as `62.5%` instead of a pixel size. The reason for this is that users have the ability to adjust the default font size to be used in their browser. By default, that font size is 16px. (16px * .625 = 10px).

An example of using REMS with the default browser font size of 16px

```css
html {
	font-size: 62.5%; /* makes font 10px */
}

/* 2.4rems = base font size ✕ 2.4 */
h1 {
	font-size: 2.4rem; /* equivalent of 24px */
}

/* 2rems = base font size ✕ 2 */
h2 {
	font-size: 2rem; /* equivalent of 20px */
}

/* 1.6rems = base font size ✕ 1.6 */
p {
	font-size: 1.6rem; /* equivalent of 16px */
}
```

This may seem like a lot of extra work and can be a bit confusing at first, however it's a powerful tool when keeping accessibility in mind. Setting the root font size as a percentage allows us to be respectful of the users requirements, while still allowing for different font sizes.

Font size can have an impact on readability and comfort, too. In general, it's best to use font sizes that aren't too small.

## Font-Weight

If any of you are designers, you will know that fonts come with a variety of weights. The weight of a font controls how bold or thin it is. Most fonts just have **normal** and **bold**, but some can have up to 9 different weights. There are two different ways to specify the font weight:

#### By keyword

```css
p.text3 {
	font-weight: bold; /* Also accepted: bold | bolder | lighter | normal | inherit */
}
```

#### By Value

```css
p.text3 {
	font-weight:600; /* From 100 to 900 in increments of 100 */
}
```

The most important things to remember here are `font-weight:normal;` and `font-weight:bold;`

## Font-Style

Similar to `font-weight`, `font-style` allows you to change the style of the font if that family permits.

The most common use case for this is for making your font italicized.

```css
p.text4 {
	font-style:italic; /* Also accepts normal, oblique, and inherit */
}
```

## Line-Height

Line height lets you explicitly set the height of a line of text as it appears in the browser. Designer types know this as **leading**. This can dramatically help the readability of large blocks of text.

Just as other values, we can set it in a variety of measurements including px, ems and %. We can also set it as a **number** and since font sizes can change, its recommended that you set line height as a multiple of itself.

By default most fonts have line height of 1.2x its font size, so a font-size of 10, would have a line height of 12.

```css
p.text5 {
	font-size: 10px;
	line-height: 1.2;
}
```

## Text-Align

`text-align` is another property that does exactly what you think it does, align text.

```css
p.text5 {
	text-align:right; /* Also accepted: left, center, justify */
}
```

## Text-Transform

`text-transform` is an extremely handy property that doesn't get used as often as it should As we talked about in the first few courses, your HTML should only describe the content and not worry about the style.

So if you have a design that relies on either all uppercase or all lowercase characters, you can still go ahead and type it with proper capitalization and then use `text-transform` to change the look of it.

```html
<h3 class="uppercase">I'm all uppercase</h3>
<h3 class="lowercase">I'M ALL LOWERCASE</h3>
<h3 class="capitalize">capitalized</h3>
```

Our CSS:

```css
.uppercase {
	text-transform:uppercase;
}
.lowercase {
	text-transform:lowercase;
}
.capitalize {
	text-transform:capitalize;
}
```

<h3 style="font-size:20px; text-transform:uppercase;">I'm all uppercase</h3>
<h3 style="font-size:20px; text-transform:lowercase;">I'M ALL LOWERCASE</h3>
<h3 style="font-size:20px; text-transform:capitalize;">capitalized</h3>

<div class="accessibility">
It's best practice to only use uppercase for short words and sentences, as using all capitals can be difficult to read. Also note that screen readers can sometimes misinterpret all capitals as acronyms, and letters will be read individually. CONTACT US becomes CONTACT U.S.
</div>

## Text-Decoration

This property, `text-decoration`, can be used to add or remove an underline.
It's not used very often because it's a best practice to only underline links. But if you do need to use it, here is an example:

```css
.underline {
	text-decoration: underline;
}
```

<p style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:underline;">Underline</p>

```css
.overline {
	text-decoration: overline;
}
```

<p style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:overline;">Overline</p>

```css
.line-through {
	text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

<p style="font-size:20px; text-decoration:line-through;">line-through</p>

`text-decoration` is used often to take the default underline off of links.

```css
a {
	text-decoration:none;
}
```

## Text-Shadow

Open <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/text-shadow.html" download>text-shadow.html</a> to play around.

Text shadow allows us to apply shadows to our text. This effect can definitely be abused and bring back horrible memories of Word Art, but with the right colours and techniques, you can use it to look really great!

Text shadow takes 4 value - **horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur, and colour.** It can also take multiple comma-separated values so you can add as many shadows to your text as you wish!

```css
.white-with-blue-shadow {
   text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;
}
```

<style>
.white-with-blue-shadow {
   text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px black;
}
</style>

<p class="white-with-blue-shadow">
   Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore 
   veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo.
</p>

## Letter-Spacing

Letter spacing allows you to control the amount of space in between letters.

```css
h3.spacing {
	letter-spacing:4px;
}
```

If you like, you can add a letter spacing of -1px to all headings to make an appealing header.

```css
h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
	letter-spacing:-1px;
}
```

<h3 style="color:red; font-size:40px;">Normal letter spacing on a heading</h3>
<h3 style="color:red; letter-spacing:-1px; font-size:40px;">-1px Spacing on a heading</h3>

Similarly, small caps look great with a little *extra* letter spacing.

```css
.small-caps {
	letter-spacing: 2px;
	text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

<h4 style="color:red; text-transform:uppercase;">Normal letter spacing for small caps</h4>
<h4 style="color:red; letter-spacing:2px; text-transform:uppercase;">2px Spacing for small caps</h4>
