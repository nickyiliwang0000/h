## Favicons

Favicons are those little images that show up in your browser's tab.

![](http://wes.io/Kq89/content)

The way we set these are really easy, we simply append the following line of HTML into the `<HEAD>`

```html
<link type="image/png" href="images/favicon.png" rel="icon">
```

Your browser will display them at 16x16 pixels but its not a bad idea to make it a little bigger as some devices are starting to use the favicon for larger bookmarking purposes. I usually recommend using a PNG (although .ico files work too) in the size of 32x32 or 48x48. Anything under 128x128 will do just fine, just keep it square!

### Apple Touch Icons
There is also another "version" of the favicon that can be used for mobile devices. It was introduced by apple and it called the Apple Touch Icon. Although Android and a few other mobile OS developers have picked it up.

Basically it allows you to specify what the image is when someone bookmarks your website on the homescreen. This means you get an App icon just like any other app!

The HTML is really similar to a fav icon:

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="somepath/image.png" />
```

It is recommended you use at least 144x144 and let the device size it down for you. However, you can specify them like this as well:

```html
<!-- Standard iPhone -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="touch-icon-iphone-114.png" />
<!-- Retina iPhone -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="114x114" href="touch-icon-iphone-114.png" />
<!-- Standard iPad -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="72x72" href="touch-icon-ipad-144.png" />
<!-- Retina iPad -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="144x144" href="touch-icon-ipad-144.png" />
```

<style>span.white {border-bottom:1px solid black; color:white; } span.white:hover {color:black;}}</style>

## Font Awesome

<!-- we are still using font awesome 4 to render the examples of the icons, however, the code snippets that we show students will references font awesome 5 -->

Icon fonts are an amazing way to implement any number of icons easily into your website. 

Rather than downloading an image, and changing the size and colour in photoshop, you can easily embed an icon "font" which will provide you with a set of commonly used icons. From there we can change the size and colour just as they are regular text.

<a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">https://fontawesome.com/</a> is the most popular, but there are many available. 

There are two ways you can embed Font Awesome on your site. You can use their stylesheet and have the icons render as web fonts or you can use their script files and have the icons render as SVGs. 

Whether you choose to import the icons as web fonts or SVGs, you will need to link your project to the necessary Font Awesome files to get started. If you would like to host the files yourself you can check out <a href="https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/hosting-font-awesome-yourself" target="_blank">Font Awesome's documentation for 'Hosting Font Awesome Yourself'</a>.  
*tl;dr: download the files they tell you, stick it in your project folder, link it in your head element*  

For our class, we're not going to be downloading the files, instead we're going to use the CDN Font Awesome has provided for us. We'll also use the “Web Fonts and & CSS” version. Head on over to <a href="https://fontawesome.com/get-started" target="_blank">Font Awesome's "Get Started" page</a> and select the “Web Fonts & CSS” tab.

Now to use an icon, we do it in HTML and use the `<i>` tag. It was previously the italic tag, but we jacked it for icons.  

We need to give the `<i>` tag **two classes**. These classes will be specified in the Font Awesome documentation. The first class you provide your icons will depend on the type of icons you're are using. There are 4 types available in Font Awesome. Since we are using the free version, we will only have access to the solid and brand icons.

For example, to get twitter, we use:

```html
<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>
```

<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>

to get a rocket:

```html
<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>
```

<i class="fa fa-rocket"></i>

For a full list, visit <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons" target="_blank">https://fontawesome.com/icons</a>

These can go inside links or any other element

```html
<a href="#" class="buyNow">Buy now! <i class="fas fa-money-bill-alt"></i></a>
```

<a href="#" class="buyNow">Buy now! <i class="fa fa-money"></i></a>

and can be styled just like any other element. You can use a parent-child selector or give it your own class. 

```html
<style>
	a.buyNow i {
		color:green;
		font-size: 50px;
	}
</style>
```

<style>
	a.buyNow i {
		color:green;
		font-size: 50px;
	}
</style>

<div class="accessibility">
Screen readers and other assistive technologies are able to read icons. Using the <code>aria-hidden</code> attribute we can define which icons should be read out and which ones should be ignored. If <code>aria-hidden</code> is set to true, screenreaders will know to skip the element. If an icon is used for decorative purposes, we most likely do not want it to be read out by screen readers, so we will want to add <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> to our <code>i</code> element.

```html
<!-- Will not be read out by screen reader. The star is just a decorative element -->
<i class="fas fa-star" aria-hidden=“true”></i>
```

However, sometimes we want our icons to be read out by screen readers. If your icons have semantic meaning, Font Awesome recommends that we add a few more things to make things more accessible. We need to add <code>aria-hidden=“true”</code> to the icon to hide it from screen readers, and supplement it with a <code>span</code>.  What you put between the span tags will get read out by screen readers. Then we add a class of <code>sr-only</code> to the span. Font awesome deals the with the styling for <code>sr-only</code> and will *visually* hide the span from users. Still with us? No? Let's check out an example:

```html
<h2>From HackerYou to Loblaws:</h2>
<i class="fas fa-walking" aria-hidden="true"></i>
<span class="sr-only">Time by walking:</span>
<p>4 minutes</p>
<i class="fas fa-bicycle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
<span class="sr-only">Time by bike:</span>
<p>1 minute</p>
```
Which will render out:
<div>
<img src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/example-font-awesome.png" alt="Example of semantic icons" width="400px">  
</div>
The walking icon and bike icon has semantic meaning. We need it to convey what each of the minutes represents. By creating the span, we can ensure that the icons are still accessible to users who do not visually benefit from icons.  

Another way to make your icons accessible is using <code>aria-label</code> attribute. This is great for interactive elements. For example, lots of sites use icons to link users to their social media. Be sure to make these icons accessible, as you want people to know they serve a purpose and are clickable:

```html
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/thisishackeryou" aria-label="Go to HackerYou's Instagram page">
  <i aria-hidden class="fab fa-instagram"></i>
</a>
```
