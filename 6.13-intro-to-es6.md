ES6
### The ECMAScript Standard

JavaScript was created in 10 days. Because of this there are a few issues with the language. Over the years there have been some additions to the language, but for a good long time there was nothing going on.

JavaScript is not actually called JavaScript, it's official name is ECMAScript (**E**uropean **C**omputer **M**anufacturers **A**ssociation). As a part of this organization there is a committee in charge driving JavaScript forward, they are called TC39 (Technical Committee 39. Badass name, right?!).

In June 2015, the TC39 committee finalized the sixth version of the ECMAScript spec, one of the biggest additions to date. It introduced quite a few new features to the language. These additions include new methods on Objects and Arrays, new function syntax, keywords like `let` and `const`, and much, much more. 

Most browsers have started to implement these features, but they can be slow to do this. Do not fear! Tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) allow us to write modern ES6 code and will perform a task called *transpiling* which takes our code and rewrites it so that **any** browser can understand it. Kind of like how Sass works: you write this nice Sass syntax, but the compiler dumbs it down to plain ol' CSS for the browser.
