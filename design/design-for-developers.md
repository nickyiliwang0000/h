# Design for Developers 101

You came to Juno to become a developer, so you might be asking why are we learning about design?

Yes we understand that you are here to become developers not designers. We don't need you to come out of the bootcamp as experts in design. In fact when you get a real development job, you will not be expected to know how to design. However development and design go hand in hand. Developers are constantly in communication with designers and other members on the team. Being able to understand the basics and talk about design is a super valuable skill to have alongside development skills and it will make you a better developer.

Making some of these common design mistakes in your projects and portfolio can actually make you look like a incapable developer. 

You will also be in charge of designing your projects in the upcoming weeks of bootcamp. We need all your projects to look as polished as possible because no potential employers wants to look at a ugly project with horrible UI! The goal for this lesson is to help you achieve that.

## 1. Defining the purpose

The first and foremost thing to consider when you are getting started with your project is asking yourself these questions:
1. What is the project?
2. What purpose does it serve? 
3. Who is the target audience? 

Having these questions answered will eventually help define the tone and personality of the project, making it much easier to make design decisions in the future.

Let's use a trivia app as an example.
1. A trivia game that contains questions from different categories
2. Providing entertainment for family/friends gatherings
3. Family members of all ages, friends. 

It is also very important to have the purpose of your project clearly stated upon first landing on it. The user needs to know what the application or site is about when they land before they would like to invest any more of their time on the site further.

## 2. Choosing a colour palette

After you've defined the purpose and tone of your project, making colour choices will be a lot easier! Your site should follow a consistent color scheme throughout the site. Pre-defining a colour palette in your planning will simplify your building process. 

You don't need to understand colour theory to create a colour palette, there are lots of tools to help you out with it!

The safest and simplest option to start creating a colour palette is to choose 5 colours: 
- **White or a very light grey (#FAFAFA)**
  A standard white is always needed mainly as the basic background colour of your website. 
- **Black or a very dark grey (#232323)**
  For paragraphs and text.
- **Primary colour**
  The main color that determines the overall look of the project. This color will define the brand, personality and tone of your project. It can be used as background colours for sections, headings or buttons. 
- **Secondary colour**
  
- **Supporting accent colours**
