# Design for Developers 101

You came to Juno to become a web developer, you might be asking why are we learning about design?

Yes we understand that you are here to become developers not designers. We don't need you to come out of the bootcamp as experts in design. In fact when you get a real development job, you will not be expected to know how to design. However development and design go hand in hand. Developers are constantly in communication with designers and other members on the team. Being able to understand the basics and talk about design is a super valuable skill to have alongside development skills and it will make you a better developer.

Making some of these common design mistakes in your projects and portfolio can actually make you look like a incapable developer. 

You will also be in charge of designing your projects in the upcoming weeks of bootcamp. We need all your projects to look as polished as possible because no potential employers wants to look at a ugly project with horrible UI! The goal for this lesson is to help you achieve that.
