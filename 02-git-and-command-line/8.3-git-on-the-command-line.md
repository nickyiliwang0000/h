### Configure Git

When Git takes snapshots of your code it, will associate them with your name and email address. This is useful when collaborating and sharing your work. Once you have Git installed, open up the command line and type the following commands with YOUR NAME AND EMAIL:

```bash
git config --global user.name Your Name
git config --global user.email  yourname@your-email.com
```

Confirm that you have set the correct username and email by typing:

```bash
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```

It should print the name and email address that you set. If there's a typo, reset either one using the same command.

## Initializing a Git repository
Now that everything is all set up, we're ready to *git* started (heh heh).

Use your command line to `cd` into the directory you want to turn into a Git project. Then run `git init` to initialize a Git repository. 

The directory will not visibly change in any way. The `git init` command actually creates a hidden folder called **.git** inside of the directory. Hopefully you've configured your computer to show hidden files. To show files like these, Mac users can type `com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES` in the command line. Windows users go to **Control Panel > Appearance and Personalization**. In **Folder Options**, select the **View** tab. Under **Advanced Settings**, select **Show hidden files, folders, and drives**.

### Ignoring things with .gitignore

We don't always want to push every file from our local directory to GitHub. Things like giant PSD files, database information, and production tools (a.k.a the `node_modules` folder) cause hella conflicts and generally mess up your workflow. In order to tell Git what to ignore when we check `git status`, we can create a `.gitignore` file with the files/folder paths to ignore.

#### Example of a .gitignore file

```bash
node_modules
.DS_Store
*.pdf
*.zip
```

It's important to create this file **BEFORE** you commit anything, as it will be difficult to ignore files that have already been committed. It is possible to remove the references to these files, but they will exist in the history of the project.

## Create a repository
Before we start adding, committing, and pushing changes to a repository, we need to know which repo we're pushing to. Though it is possible to [create a GitHub repo via the command line by accessing their API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create), it's much more straightforward to just do it from the website itself.  

1. Log in to [github.com](http://github.com).
2. Follow the instructions for creating a repository here: [https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo) but **skip the "Create a README for your repository"** section.
3. From the command line, navigate to your local repository (hint: use `cd`)
4. Add the GitHub repository as a **remote** using the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<yourusername>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

This line can be copied from the new repo's instructions.

This step creates a relationship between your local repository and the repository hosted on github.com. [Like Dorian Gray and Basil Hallward's painting of him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Picture_of_Dorian_Gray#Plot), these repos are linked so you can pass information between them and update each from the other. 

### Git workflow
When using Git, whether through a GUI or command line, its best practice to adhere to a strict workflow. Let's go over the process and some terminology.

#### Working directory
The **working directory** is the folder that contains all your project files.  This is where you make changes to your code, and add or remove files.

#### Staging area / adding updated files
The **staging area** is where you collect updated files/folders to eventually be saved as a "snapshot" or version of your project.  Only the files that have been changed need to be staged.

In the GitHub GUI, when any files are changed, they show up in the **changes** tab and stay there until you commit them.

When using the command line, changes need to be *added* to the staging area. You can do this with the command `git add <file>`. There are several different ways to add files.

`git add file-name` : Add/stage a specific file
`git add -A` : Add/stage all new, modified and deleted files
`git add .` : Add/stage new and modified, without deleted files
`git add -u` : Add/stages modified and deleted, without new files

#### Commit your changes
**Commit** your changes and updates to take the snapshot of your project.  Every commit should contain a short message that summarizes the changes being committed. (the `-m` flag stands for message)

	git commit -m "added styling for mobile, removed extra files"

For your first commit, it's common for your message to be "initial commit".

#### Git `status`

To see which files are in the working directory and which are in the staging area or just to what's going on in general, use `git status`.  You can use this command at any step to check the status of your files.

#### Git `push`

Note that all these steps are happening *locally* on your computer.  Your repository that is hosted online via github.com has not changed yet. (The painting of Dorian is still beautiful.) We need to **push** the code to get it go up into the repository.

```bash
	git push origin master
```
You may have noticed that we used the word `origin` once before: when we linked your github.com repo with your local one. Think about what we might be doing here. We'll go into exactly what `origin` and `master` mean a little later. You should now see your changes on github.com.

If we're working through flow this as a class, we may have some trouble pushing to our repositories. Since we're all working from the same IP address, GitHub thinks we're might be malicious and temporarily stop us from pushing our code. If you find that you are having trouble pushing to master, wait a few minutes and try again.


**Git workflow**:

1. Work (code, make changes, add/remove files, etc.)
2. Add files to staging area when you're done a chunk of work. (`git add <file>`)
3. Take a snapshot (`git commit -m "a useful commit message here"`)
4. `git push origin master` to update github.com repository.
5. Repeat steps 1-4.

### Exercise

* Navigate to one of your project folders and make it a Git repository. 
* Add all of the files in the folder into the staging area.
* Take a snapshot by committing with the message "initial commit".

**Pro-tip: commit early - commit often**

It's tempting to wait until you're "done" to make a commit but it's better to commit early and often.  Commit every time you've completed a small chunk of code, milestone or feature. The more often you commit, the more "snapshots" and backup copies you'll have to roll back to if you've really messed up your code!  

When you are actively working on a project, try to commit at **least** at the end of the day (though it'll probably be more likely that you'll commit several times a day).  Even if you're not done a feature, your commit message could just be "saving work".
