# What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a tool you can use to create live sites hosted by GitHub directly from your GitHub repos!

You can make a website for your user account, an organization you belong to, or for an individual project. You get **one** top-level site per GitHub account (or organization) and unlimited project sites.

This means that you can have `studentname.portfolio.com` and `studentname.portfolio.com/coolproject` at the same time, but you can't have `studentname.portfolio.com` and `coolproject.portfolio.com`.

## How to create a site from a repo
Let's start with a new site for an individual project. There are two options:

1. generate a site with one of the pre-built themes
2. create a site from scratch

We're going to do a the second one.

### Create a site from scratch

1. Head over to github.com and create a new repository including a README file. **If you're using an existing repo, skip to step 3.**

1. Clone the repo to make a local copy. 
  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
  ```
1. Using the command line, `cd` into the new repo. 
  ```bash
  cd repo-name
  ```

1. Create and switch to a branch called `gh-pages`.

  ```bash
  git checkout -b gh-pages
  ```

  As we've learned, `git checkout` switches between branches, and the `-b` flag creates a new branch at the same time. In our case, `git checkout -b gh-pages` both creates and switches to a new branch called `gh-pages`.

  We should get this message to confirm the switch:

  ```bash
  Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'
  ```

  (You may get an error message saying you don't have admin privileges, in which case you'll need to type `sudo` at the start of that command.)

1. If this is a new repository, create an `index.html` file (use the `touch` command).
  * If this is an existing repository, make a change to your local copy. 

2. Add, commit, and push the update to the gh-pages branch via the GUI or command line.

  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ```

  **NOTE:** In this case, `master` refers to the  will be pushing our updates to the gh-pages branch, not master.

  In the GitHub GUI, go to the **Branches** tab and ensure gh-pages is selected. In the command line, your push command will be:

  ```bash
  git push origin gh-pages
  ```

To get our website up and running using [github.com](http://github.com), your files must be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. However, this does not automatically update/sync your master branch.

It's that easy! Your site can be viewed at **http://username.github.io/repository-name**.

**NOTE:** You can run `git status` to check which branch you are currently on if you're using the command line.

### Syncing branches

Go to the branch that you want to *update*. In the above exercise, we made the changes to the `gh-pages` branch so we need to switch to `master` to update master.

```bash
git checkout master
```

To bring the current branch up to date with branch containing the changes, we'll use the `rebase` command. The below example will take the commits from `gh-pages` and put them into `master`.

```bash
git rebase gh-pages
```

Now we have to `push` these changes to the repository on GitHub.

```bash
git push origin master
```

## Site with pre-built theme
<!-- 1. Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and create a **new repo**.
2. Click on Settings on the right hand side.
3. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages module and select Automatic Page Generator.
4. Use the editor to add content to your index.html. When you're done, click Continue to Layouts.
5. Pick a theme and select Publish. Fin! -->

Your site url is **http://username.github.io/repository**. It may take a couple of minutes for your page to show up the first time.

###Optional: Make gh-pages the default branch
In the repository, go to the **Settings** page. Then in **Options** in the top section, set the default branch in the dropdown.
