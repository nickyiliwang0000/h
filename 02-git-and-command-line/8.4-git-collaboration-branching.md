# Git collaboration: branching

When you're working with files on GitHub, you may want to keep a clean copy locally and tinker with some new feature or wild idea. Great! You're ready to make a _branch_!

## Branch workflow setup
Branches are copies of a repository's files. They're a safe place to mess around with the code for your project without:
  1. creating a new git repo for the same project
  2. messing up your project

This diagram represents a sample git workflow for a repo: 

![git branching diagram](http://cl.ly/image/3a3M3U2S0v3X/gitbranches.png)

The `master` branch is the _production_ branch (a.k.a. the official finished version of the repo, and probably the one that is live on the internet).

The `feature` branches are where individual developers are writing code and figuring out new features or updates for the website.

(Sometimes a larger company will have a `test` branch where the dev team is trying out new features and seeing how they mesh with the `master` code **without** messing up the live site. We'll only be working with `master` branches and `feature` branches.)

## Working with branches
Download [these starter files](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/git-branching-lesson.zip) and initialize git in the root directory. Then, go to GitHub and create a repo. Add that repo's URL as the origin with `git remote add origin` and commit your starter files. Then, follow along with the next steps.

<!-- ## Create a new test branch
From inside our git-initialized project folder, the command `git checkout -b test` creates a new trackable branch called `test` and moves us over to it. `git push origin test` sends this branch to GitHub. 

Let's go into our `index.html` and add a title to our project. Add, commit, and push that change to the `test` branch on GitHub:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "changing title"
git push origin test
```
You should see on GitHub that you have a new branch called `test` and it has the title it it. -->

## Create a new feature branch

`git checkout -b myfeaturebranch master` creates a new trackable branch called `myfeaturebranch` using the `master` branch as a base. This is where you'll write the code that creates a feature for your website. Let's toss an `h1` in `index.html`.

## Working on a feature branch

When you're on your feature branch, `git pull origin master` will grab the changes from your `master` branch and add them to your feature branch so you can begin work using the most recent code.

## Switching branches 

If you need to switch to another branch before you're ready to commit your changes, `git stash` will put away the current changes on your branch for later so you can go do stuff in another branch (`git checkout anotherfeaturebranch` to take you to `anotherfeaturebranch` if it's already set up) without having to commit these changes.

`git checkout myfeaturebranch` will bring you back to your feature branch and `git stash apply` will bring back what you put away on on `myfeaturebranch`.

## When you're ready to commit your changes
Back on `myfeaturebranch`, add, commit, and push the change we made to the `myfeaturebranch` branch on GitHub:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "adding an h1"
git push origin myfeaturebranch
```

## Merge a feature branch into master

1. Use `git branch` to check which branch you're on.
   * If you're in your `myfeaturebranch`, use `git checkout master` to switch to your `master` branch.
2. Use `git pull origin master` to make sure your local is up to date with the latest from the upstream `master`. 
3. Use `git merge myfeaturebranch` to merge your feature branch into the `master` branch.
4. Use `git commit origin master` to commit your merge.
5. Use `git push origin master` to push your merge to the master branch of your repo on GitHub.

If you've got merge conflicts, now is a great time to sit down with your teammates and see which changes you want to keep.

### (Optional) Delete the feature branch if you don't need to come back to it
If you're in your feature branch, use `git checkout master` to go somewhere that's not the branch you want to delete.
Use `git push origin :myfeaturebranch`  to delete the myfeaturebranch branch on GitHub (upstream). 
`git branch -d myfeaturebranch` will delete the branch on your computer.
