### Variables

A jar to store a something you might want to use again in your code. It is best to start off declaring variables using the keyword `const`. `const` variables cannot be reassigned.

```js
const myStringVariable = "whatever" 
const myNumberVariable = 42 
const myBooleanVariable = true  // can only be 'true' or 'false'
```

If you need to update a variable, be sure to declare the variable with the keyword `let`. When reassigning your variable to a new value, you can omit the `let` keyword.

```js 
let myNumberVariable = 42 
myNumberVariable = 7;
```

### Functions 

A group of code that can be run repeatedly.

#### Defining a function (write out a set of instructions)

```js
function myFunction(){
  //do stuff
}

//OR (alternate syntax)

const myFunction = function(){
  //do stuff
}
```

#### Calling a function (make it go!)

```js
myFunction();
```
#### Functions with parameters/arguments

**Parameters** can be used to pass in extra options to our function when it runs. This makes them even more versatile and re-usable. 

You might hear parameters referred to as **arguments**. Techinically, this is what we they're called when calling the function.

```js
function myFunction(param1, param2){
  //do something with param1 and param2
  console.log(param1);
  console.log('But also, ' + param2);
}

myFunction ("whatever", "pshaw!");
```
Logs:

```
> whatever
> But also, pshaw!
```
##### Stopping a function (return)

We can use `return` to quit out of a function without executing any further code.

```js
function singMeASong(){
  console.log("I got my first real six string.");
  return;
  console.log("Played it 'til my fingers bled.");
}

singMeASong();
```
logs:   

```
> I got my first real six string.
```

We can also use return to make our function give back a value when it's called.

```js
function bakeACake(){
  //do some cake baking things
  return "oreo cheesecake";
}

const myCake = bakeACake();
console.log(myCake);
```

logs:

```
> oreo cheesecake 
```

### Arrays
 
A grouped collection of items, ordered by a numeric index. You can think of an array as a fancy variable that can hold more than hold multiple things.

#### Define an empty array

```js
myArray = [];
```

#### Define an array with some things in it.

Items in an array are comma separated.

```js
myLuckyNumbers = [8, 84];
myAnimals = ["alligator", "monkey", "snake"];
```

#### Add a new thing to an array

```js
myAnimals.push("lion"); //myArray now equals ["aligator", "monkey", "snake", "lion"];
```

#### Get items from an array

The location of items in an array is based on a numeric **index*, which starts counting from zero. i.e. the fourth item in the array will have an index of 3. 

```js
myLuckyNumbers[0]; // 8
myAnimals[2]; // "snake"
```

### Objects

Objects are like super-powered arrays! They're still collections of items, but this time each item can be labelled with it's own key. We often store both variables and functions inside objects.

#### Define an empty object 

```js
myObject = {};
```

#### Define an object with some things in it

Variables are called **properties** when they're inside objects.
Functions are called **methods** when they're inside objects.

```js
myObject = {
  myProperty : "value",
  myOtherProp : "another value",
  myMethod : function(){
      console.log("I'm a method!");
  }
};
```

#### Retrieve an item from an object

You can retrive properties with two different syntaxes, dot notation, or key-value lookup notation.

```js
myObject.property; //"value"
myObject["property"]; //"value"
```
You can call a method (run the function) using dot notation.

```js
myObject.myMethod(); // logs > I'm a method!
```

#### Add new items to an object

You can also add new properties and methods to your object after it has been created.

```js
myObject.newProp = "I'm new here";
myObject["newProp"] = "I'm new here";
myObject.newMethod = function (){
  //do some new things
}
```

### If statements (aka "control flow")

If statements are used to make decisions with your code.

#### Basic format

```js
if (condition to evaluate) {
  //do stuff if the condition hold true
}

if (3 > 1) {
  console.log("yup, three is bigger than one!");
}

if (5 < 2) {
  console.log("never gonna happen");
}
```
logs:

```
> yup, three is bigger than one!  
```

#### Adding a catch-all (else)

You can add a fallback block of code that will execute if your condition isn't met.

```js
if (5 < 2){
  console.log("never gonna happen");
} else {
  console.log("who took all the truth, you guys?")
}
```

logs:

```
> who took all the truth, you guys?
```

#### Checking for multiple conditions (else if)

You can add even more conditions to test within a single if statement by using else if. You can use as many else if statements as you like, and else (catch-all) is still optional.

```js
const country = "United States";

if (country === "canada") {
  console.log("Oh Canada!");
} else if (country === "United States")
  console.log("'MURICA") {
} else if (country === "Mexico"){
  console.log("Hola!");
} else {
  console.log("hello world!")
}
```
logs:

```js
> MURICA
```

#### Complex conditionals

You can use logical operators (and, or, not) to create more complex conditional statements.

**&&** and    
**||** or    
**!** not    

```js
const name = "Bob";
const email = "bob@hotmail.com"
const hairColour = "blonde"

if (name === "Bob" && email === "bob@hotmail.com"){
  // this code only evaluates if BOTH conditions hold true
  console.log('identity verified');
}

if (name === "Bob" || name === "Robert") {
  // this code executies if any one of the conditions hold true
  console.log("Hey buddy!")
} 

if (hairColour !== "blonde"){
  console.log('Halt, impostor!');
}
```

logs:

```js
>   identity verified
>   Hey buddy!
```

### `for` loops 

For loops can be used to repeat a set of instructions over and over again. 

#### Loop using a counter

Takes the general form:

```js
for(start; stop; increment) {
    // do this each time
}
```

In practice:

```js
for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("The current count of the loop is " + i);
}
```

logs:

```
> The current count of the loop is 1
> The current count of the loop is 2
> The current count of the loop is 3
> The current count of the loop is 4
```

#### Loop through an array 

We can use for loops to iterate over all the items within an array, by using 0 as the start position and the length of the array as the end condition.
*Remember, the item at index "n" in an array can be retrieved using array[n];*

```js
myAnimals = ["aligator", "monkey", "snake", "lion"];

for(let i = 0; i < myAnimals.length; i++){
  console.log("Look at this " + myAnimals[i] + ". Just look at it.");
}
```

logs:

```js
> Look at this aligator. Just look at it.
> Look at this monkey. Just look at it.
> Look at this snake. Just look at it.
> Look at this lion. Just look at it.
```

#### Loop through an object `for...in`

We can use a special kind of for loop - the for in loop - to iterate over the key value pairs of an object. When looping over obejcts, we can output both the name of the key and it's associated value. *Remeber: you can retreive the property with key, "prop" from an object using object["prop"];*

```js
const dinnerOrder = {
  appetizer: "fried calamari",
  main: "chicken parmesean",
  dessert: "tiramisu"
}

for (course in dinnerOrder){
  const sentence = "The " + course + " course is " + dinnerOrder[course] + ".";
  console.log(sentence);
}
```

logs:

```
> The appetizer course is fried calamari.
> The main course is chicken parmesan.
> The dessert course is tiramisu.
```
