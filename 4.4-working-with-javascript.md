## JavaScript Variables and Functions

### Variables and Functions

Let's look at an example using variables and functions.  We know that the `prompt()` function allows the user to input text. What if we wanted to hold onto that text to use for later?

Functions in JavaScript can be assigned as a value to a variable.

Using `prompt("What is your name?")`, let's create a variable to hold the value and `alert()` a message with that value.

```js
const name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello " + name + ".");
```

When the browser runs this code, it stops at the `prompt()` function call and waits for the user to input their answer. That *value* is then stored into the `name` variable which we then pass and as an argument to the `alert()` function.

#### More built-in functions
We've already looked `prompt()`, `alert()` and `confirm()` but there are many more built-in functions. Many of these also return *values* that we can store in variables. For example:

* console.log() //No return value
* `Math.` //Return value
Type `Math.` (without hitting enter) and you'll see a list pop up of available math related functions. E.g., `Math.cos()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()` and many more.

Note that these functions look a little different from the previously discussed since they have a `prefix. functionname()` syntax. We will be discussing **objects** in another lesson and will expand on this.

Just like CSS properties, there are too many different functions to memorize them all so it's a good idea to have some handy resources nearby. Go to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and use the search box at the top of the page to learn more about these functions. 

**HINT:** You will need to use these functions for the following exercises.

## JavaScript Syntax

### Syntax & Code Conventions
When do we use semi-colons? Why did the computer complain when we typed `'She's a HackerYou student'`? Just like any other language, there are rules (or grammar) to be followed. Computers need code written in a very specific way or they will not understand it. 

#### Semi-colons
Code is composed of **statements** (instructions) that are usually executed one at a time from top to bottom. Statements end with a semi-colon to indicate the end of the instruction.

```js
const name = "Your Name";
name;
	
//same as
	
const name = "Your Name"; name;
```

**Note:** Because of a technique called **automatic semicolon insertion** (ASI), some statements that are "well formed" on a new line will be executed as if a semicolon had been added. 

```js
// will execute both statements
const name = "Your Name" 
name;
	
// will throw an error
const name = "Your Name" name;
```

In the example above, when the statement is on a new line, the instruction will run as if there was a semicolon there thanks to ASI.

**However some will argue that you do not need semi-colons. To avoid errors, it's best practice to put each new statement on it's own line and end it with a semicolon.**

**Block Statements:** Used to group zero or more statements enclosed by a pair of curly brackets `{ }`. Single line statements should end in a semi-colon but the block itself does not. Generally used with **control flow statements** (to be discussed later).

```js
let singleLineStatement = "hello"; //needs semi-colon
	
if (condition === "something"){
	let singleLineStatement = "hello"; //needs semi-colon
	let anotherStatement = "hi"; //needs semi-colon
} //does not need semi-colon
```

Here's a handy [Stack Overflow discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1834642/best-practice-for-semicolon-after-every-function-in-javascript) about when semi-colons are needed. And here is a great video  [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlr-FGbhKaI) on the subject.

   
**Exercise**: In the example below, add the semicolons and line breaks that allow the code to run without errors.

```js
"I'm just a value!" let schoolName = "HackerYou" let numOfStudents = 25 schoolName + " has " + numOfStudents + " students." 
```


## JavaScript and HTML Best Practices

### Adding Javascript to HTML Pages
Like CSS, JavaScript can be added to your HTML pages inline or as an external file.

To include it internally, write all of your JavaScript within a `<script></script>` tag. Though the tags can be added in the `<head>` or anywhere in the `<body>`, it is usually added at the bottom of the page, just before the closing `</body>` tag.

```html
<script>
	// js code here
</script> 
</body>
```

To include it as an external file, save your file using a `.js` extension and link to it using the script tag with a `src` attribute like this:

```html
<script src="scripts.js"></script> 
```
	
Note that prior to HTML5, an additional `type` attribute was required so you may see external JavaScript files linked this way as well:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="scripts.js"></script> 
```

In the external JavaScript file you don't include `<script>` tags, just the JavaScript code itself.
