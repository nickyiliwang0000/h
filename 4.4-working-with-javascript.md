JavaScript Variables and Functions
### Variables and Functions

Let's look at an example using variables and functions.  We know that the `prompt()` function allows the user to input text. What if we wanted to hold onto that text to use for later?

Functions in JavaScript can be assigned as a value to a variable.

Using `prompt("What is your name?")`, let's create a variable to hold the value and `alert()` a message with that value.

```js
const name = prompt("What is your name?");
alert("Hello " + name + ".");
```

When the browser runs this code, it stops at the `prompt()` function call and waits for the user to input their answer. That *value* is then stored into the `name` variable which we then pass and as an argument to the `alert()` function.

#### More built-in functions
We've already looked `prompt()`, `alert()` and `confirm()` but there are many more built-in functions. Many of these also return *values* that we can store in variables. For example:

* console.log() //No return value
* `Math.` //Return value
Type `Math.` (without hitting enter) and you'll see a list pop up of available math related functions. E.g., `Math.cos()`, `Math.max()`, `Math.min()` and many more.

Note that these functions look a little different from the previously discussed since they have a `prefix. functionname()` syntax. We will be discussing **objects** in another lesson and will expand on this.

Just like CSS properties, there are too many different functions to memorize them all so it's a good idea to have some handy resources nearby. Go to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and use the search box at the top of the page to learn more about these functions. 

**HINT:** You will need to use these functions for the following exercises.
