GitHub Pages can be used to create live sites hosted by GitHub directly from your GitHub projects.

You can make a website for your user account, an organization you belong to, or host individual projects. You get one top-level site per GitHub account and organization and unlimited project sites.

Sites can be written using Markdown to ease formatting issues, and then get a prepackaged theme through the GitHub site. For help formatting Markdown, use this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Project site
Let's start with a new site for an individual project. There are two options:

* generate a site with one of the pre-built themes
* create a site from scratch

## Create a site from scratch

1. Head over to github.com and create a new repository including a Read Me file. **If you're using an existing repo, skip to step 3.**

1. Clone the repo to make a local copy. Using the command line, `cd` into the new repo. 

	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
	$ cd repo-name
	```

1. Create and switch to a branch called `gh-pages`.

	```bash
	$ git checkout -b gh-pages
	```

	As we've learned, `git checkout` switches between branches, and the `-b` flag creates a new branch at the same time. In our case, `git checkout -b gh-pages` both creates and switches to a new branch called `gh-pages`.

	We should get this message to confirm the switch:

	```bash
	Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages'
	```

	(You may get an error message saying you don’t have admin privileges, in which case you’ll need to type `sudo` at the start of that command.)

1. Create an `index.html` file (use the `touch` command) if this is a new repository or make a change to your local copy. Then **add**, **commit** and **push** the update via the GUI or command line.

	**NOTE:** We will be pushing our updates to the gh-pages branch, not master.

	In the GitHub GUI, go to the **Branches** tab and ensure gh-pages is selected. In the command line, your push command will be:

	```bash
	$ git push origin gh-pages
	```

To get our website up and running using [github.com](http://github.com), your files must be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch. However, this does not automatically update/sync your master branch.

It's that easy! Your site can be viewed at **http://username.github.io/repository-name**.

**NOTE:** You can run `git status` to check which branch you are currently on if you're using the command line.

### Syncing branches

Go to the branch that you want to *update*. In the above exercise, we made the changes to the `gh-pages` branch so we need to switch to `master` to update master.

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

To bring the current branch up to date with branch containing the changes, we'll use the `rebase` command. The below example will take the commits from `gh-pages` and put them into `master`.

```bash
$ git rebase gh-pages
```

Now we have to `push` these changes to the repository on GitHub.

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

## Site with pre-built theme
1. Go to [github.com](http://github.com) and create a **new repo**.
2. Click on Settings on the right hand side.
3. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages module and select Automatic Page Generator.
4. Use the editor to add content to your index.html. When you're done, click Continue to Layouts.
5. Pick a theme and select Publish. Fin!

Your site url is **http://username.github.io/repository**. It may take a couple of minutes for your page to show up the first time.

###Optional: Make gh-pages the default branch
In the repository, go to the **Settings** page. Then in **Options** in the top section, set the default branch in the dropdown.

## Static site generators
There are a few tools available that can help you build a full blog that can be hosted on Github Pages
