## Text Editor - Visual Studio Code 

One of the most important tools for a developer to use is a good text editor. The code editor is where a developer does the vast majority of their problem-solving and coding. Using the right text editor with a great setup can make productivity go through the roof.

HTML is written is plain text, so we could technically use Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) to view and code our HTML files. However, since both programs show nothing but black text on a white background, it's very easy to make a mistake!

Text editors give you something called *syntax highlighting*, which colour-codes your tags to help you quickly scan your code for relevant parts. When you make a mistake, the colour of the tag changes and it's visually clear that something isn't right. Take a look this snippet in TextEdit:

Now look at it in a code editor:

Note how all the tags are blue and the current selected tag `<body>` is underlined yellow? When your code gets long and nested, little tips like these are very helpful for finding errors.

#### Choosing a Text Editor

There are many text editors in the world of development, and each has their own set of features. When choosing a text editor, look for signs that it's easily customizable and has an active development community.

For this bootcamp, we are going to be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a free text editor developed by Microsoft. VSCode has been gaining a lot of traction in the industry due to it's excellent features, including: 
- syntax highlighting
- intelligent code completion (intellisense) 
- snippets
- debugging
- built in Git 

Some other popular text editors currently available are:

**Sublime Text = [http://www.sublimetext.com/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)**
Paid (with unlimited free trial) with extensive customization options. Widely used (you might be using Sublime if you are coming to us from part time!)

**Atom - [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)** 
Free, open source text editor from GitHub. Easily customizable and shares many of the same plugins, features and themes as Sublime.

**Brackets - [http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/)**
Free, open source text editor from Adobe. Easily integrated with other Adobe products (e.g. Photoshop).

**WebStorm - [https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) and PhpStorm - [https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)**
IDE (Integrated Development Development) that provides tools for specific languages.

We do **not recommend** using Dreamweaver as it comes with many shortcuts that will make it difficult for you to understanding the code you're writing.

### Installing Visual Studio Code 
If you haven't already, head on over to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">https://code.visualstudio.com</a> to download and install the latest stable build of VSCode.

### Getting Started
If you are exploring VSCode for the first time, it's helpful to visit the Welcome window at `help` > `welcome`. Here, you'll see a few options; you can open a new or recent file as well as launch the interactive playground which is a great place to learn some basic shortcuts.

Let's take some time to run through some of the interactve playground sections that are relevant to us right now: 
- Multi cursor editing
- Line actions
- Formatting
- Code folding
- Errors and warnings

### Installing Extensions

#### WakaTime
Over the course of the bootcamp, we keep track of the hours you spend coding - this will be cool for you to see at the end of the program! Visit this link [https://wakatime.com/](https://wakatime.com/) and get an API key. When you have that, head back to VSCode and:

  1. Type in `CMD + Shift + P` and type `install`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extension`
  2. Type `wakatime` and hit `enter`.
  3. Restart Visual Studio Code 
  4. Enter your API key, and press `enter`.


#### Open-in-browser
This extension will allow you to use a shortcut to preview your HTML files in your default browser.
  
  1. Type in `CMD + Shift + P` and type `install`. Pick `Extensions: Install Extension`
  2. Type `open in browser` and hit `enter`.
  3. Install & restart Visual Studio Code 
  4. Open HTML files in default browser by pressing `alt + b` or right clicking and selecting `open in browser`.

### Make it look good

Visual Studio Code, like many other text editors, gives us the ability to customize the appearance of our working files. There are a few default themes installed, and to switch yours visit `Code` > `Preferences` > `Color Theme` or use the shortcut `cmd + K cmd + T` to launch a window with the preinstalled options. You can also select `Install Additional Color Themes` which will launch the Extensions panel with infinite options available for you to install and check out. You can switch this up as much as you like - eventually you will find a setup that works well for you. 

Some staff favourites are `Oceanic Next`, `Material Theme`, `Material Dark`, and `Cobalt 2`.

### Edit User Settings 

It's worthwhile to spend a bit of time customizing your text editor since you will be spending so much time with it. You can override defaults in your user settings file which can be found at `Code` > `Preferences` > `Settings` or via the shortcut `cmd ,`. You can play around with the visual interface provide or if you click on the three dots in the corner and go to  `Open in settings.json` you can customize the settings in JSON.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is a data format that, despite its name, is language independent. (Thought we will be seeing it again when we get into JavaScript.) JSON's syntax uses key-value pairs that are separated by commas, with a colon between they key (name) and the value, like this: 

```json
{
  "setting 1" : "On Wednesdays we have Salad Club"
}

```

Right now, your settings file might be empty or only contain the rules that define the theme you selected. Eventually you might have your own list of settings that work for you, but for now here are some that you might enjoy! 

```json
{
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
    "emmet.includeLanguages": {
        "javascript" : "javascriptreact"
    }
}
```

There are some things to note about the above syntax. The last key value pair on the list has no trailing comma. All keys and most values are wrapped in **double quotes**. The exceptions are when you are using numbers,

```json
{
  "editor.tabSize": 2
}
```

or when the value some key is set to `true` or `false` (we call these values *boolean* values). 

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnPaste": true
}
```


### Enter Zen Mode

If you want to focus on your code and have no distraction from the tool bars, you can toggle "zen mode" by going to `View` > `Toggle Zen Mode` which can also be done by the shortcut `cmd + K, Z`.

We'll be learning more about this text editor as the course goes on and features become useful to us. If you're keen to take an even deeper dive, you can check out these [Intro Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) to get a preview of what's in store!
