# Complex and Simple Components

Up until now, we've been building all of our components like this:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div>
				My application!
			</div>
		)
	}
}
```

But did you know that there's a simpler way that you can create components? 

## Simple Components
When you create a new React component using `class extends`, you gain access to a lot of goodies: the ability to add state, lifecycle hooks, etc. We will now refer to these components as *complex* or *stateful* components.

A lot of the time you'll be building a component that needs to display a little bit of UI â€“ it doesn't need to have state or lifecycle hooks, it's just rendering some information. To build that component, you can use something what we'll call a *simple* component from now on.  (You may also see this called a *stateless* component or *presentational* component.) 

A simple component looks like this:

```javascript
const MySimpleComponent = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			Hello friends!
		</div>
	)
} 
```

You can include them in your code just like the more robust `class extends` style Components:

```javascript
const MySimpleComponent = () => {
	return (
		<div>
			Hello friends!
		</div>
	)
} 

class App extends Component {
	return (
	<div>
		<MySimpleComponent />
	</div>
	)
}
```

**Simple components cannot hold any state**. If you need to provide some custom information to your simple components, you can do that using **props**. 

Props are a way to pass data from one component to another. For our purposes, think of them as information that gets passed from parent to child component which will affect the way the child component is rendered.

For example, if we wanted to build a simple component that displayed a featured donut, it might look like this:

```javascript
const FeaturedDonut = (props) => {
	return (
		<div>
			<p>Today's featured donut is {props.name}.</p>
		</div>
	)
}

class App extends Component {
	render {
		return (
		<div>
			<FeaturedDonut name="PB&J" />
		</div>
		)
	}
}
```
Here, the `name` prop is being passed to the `FeaturedDonut` component and should render in our browser wherever the code has `{props.name}`.

We'll cover props in more detail in the next lesson, along with some examples of when they can be incredibly useful in building your application.
