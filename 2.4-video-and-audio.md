# HTML5 Video

One of the new tools available to us within HTML5 is native video. Currently, the video tag is supported in all major browsers so we can use it in our projects. Prior to this, any video we wanted to use on our sites had to stored in Flash formats.

The video tag looks like this

```html
<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

Which outputs this:

<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4" autoplay>
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

How the above tag works, is much like the ``img`` tag, we need to provide a ``src`` attribute that points to where our video file is located. Currently, all major, modern browsers support the video tag and will render a standard video player on the page.

### Adding some controls

Just a video by itself doesn't make much sense, as there's no way to control playing, pausing or resizing it. Simply by passing a few key attributes to the video element, we can create built-in controls for the video.

```html
<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4" controls>
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4" controls>
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

 
In order to autoplay the video, provide an `autoplay` attribute to the video element. By default, `controls` will pause the video if `autoplay` is not included. Each browser also has their own policies regarding autoplay in HTML5 videos. As of April 2018, Chrome has adopted stricter autoplay rules, in hopes of improving the overall user experience. In order for the `autoplay` attribute to work in Chrome, the video element should also include the `muted` attribute. However, autoplay with sound is still possible for users on desktop, if they've interacted with the domain or <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#mei" target="_blank">have passed the Media Engagement Index threshold</a>, meaning they've previously played the video with sound . On Chrome's mobile browser, a user can also have a non-muted video autoplay, if they've added the webpage to their home screen (more on general autoplay rules on mobile devices next!). <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes" target="_blank">To read more about Chrome's new policy, click here</a>.

```html
<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4" controls muted autoplay>
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

<video src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/OurLearningLoop.mp4" controls muted autoplay>
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>

Quick Note: Video elements with `autoplay` will also work if the `controls` attribute is included. However, if there is no `controls` attribute, you will need to include the `muted` attribute. As of May 2018, Firefox and Safari still allow videos without `controls` or `muted` attributes.

 
#### Autoplay on Mobile Devices
You may notice that videos you set to autoplay, does not always autoplay when you are on a mobile device. Many mobile operating systems have disabled this feature. Since videos can often use a lot of data to load, these operating systems prevent videos from automatically playing so that users do not end up using too much of their monthly data allowance. For newer versions of Safari (mobile), you may still be able to enable autoplay, if the video meets a certain set of conditions, <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/" target="_blank">which can be found in this article</a>. 


### Providing Fallbacks

As of the current date, all major browsers support the mp4 format for video. However, older browsers will require different formats such as OGG and WEBM to be supplied in cases that they don't support MP4. In order to provide these fallback formats, we need to add a `source` element inside the video element with a **src** attribute that points to the files. At the bottom of the list of source attributes, you can provide text that displays if nothing is supported.

```html
<video autoplay controls>
  <source src="http://hackeryou.com/wp-content/themes/hackeryou/assets/images/videos/OurLearningLoop.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="http://hackeryou.com/wp-content/themes/hackeryou/assets/images/videos/OurLearningLoop.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  <source src="http://hackeryou.com/wp-content/themes/hackeryou/assets/images/videos/OurLearningLoop.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```

### Some other attributes

<table class="reference notranslate">
  <tbody><tr>
    <th style="width:20%">Attribute</th>
    <th style="width:20%">Value</th>
    <th style="width:50%">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">autoplay</td>
    <td>autoplay</td>
    <td>Specifies that the video will start playing as soon as it is ready</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">controls</td>
    <td>controls</td>
    <td>Specifies that video controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button etc).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">height</td>
    <td><i>pixels</i></td>
    <td>Sets the height of the video player</td>
      </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">loop</td>
    <td>loop</td>
    <td>Specifies that the video will start over again, every time it is finished</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">muted</td>
    <td>muted</td>
    <td>Specifies that the audio output of the video should be muted</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">poster</td>
    <td><em>URL</em></td>
    <td>Specifies an image to be shown while the video is downloading, or until the user hits the play button</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">preload</td>
    <td>auto<br>
	metadata<br>
	none</td>
    <td>Specifies if and how the author thinks the video should be loaded when the page loads</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">src</td>
    <td><i>URL</i></td>
    <td>Specifies the URL of the video file</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="html5badge">width</td>
    <td><i>pixels</i></td>
    <td>Sets the width of the video player</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

### Audio

There is also an audio tag which works similarly to the video tag. You will also need to provide fallbacks for older browsers and pay attention to your autoplay and controls settings. 


```html
    <audio controls>
      <source src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/service-bell_daniel_simion.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      <source src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/service-bell_daniel_simion.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      Your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element.
    </audio>
```

That code will produce this :

<audio controls>
      <source src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/service-bell_daniel_simion.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
      <source src="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/service-bell_daniel_simion.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
      Your browser doesn't support the HTML5 audio element.
    </audio>


<div class="accessibility">
In order to make audio and video accessible, you will need to provide a <strong>transcript</strong> for your users. You can either type it up yourself, find a volunteer or turn to a third party service that will create the transcript for a fee. The transcript should be linked in the same place as the audio or video. <strong>Audio descriptions</strong> should also be provided when necessary. Audio description will explain what is in the visuals so that the video is accessible to people who are blind. Most videos will not require audio description. For example, you do not need to provide audio description of people talking or text on a slideshow if it has already been read out by a presenter in the video. <strong>Captions</strong> are sometimes required, but mostly they are considered as something that's nice to have. They are important especially when users need to see whatâ€™s happening in the video, but also receive audio information in text format at the same time. <strong>Sign language</strong> is not required but encouraged to be included when possible. <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/06/video-notes" target="_blank">For more information on how to make audio and videos accessible, check out the W3C Multimedia Accessibility FAQ page</a>.
