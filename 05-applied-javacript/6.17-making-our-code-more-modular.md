Like with CSS, as we write more and more JavaScript, our code runs the risk of becoming unwieldy and big.

With SASS, we were able to solve this issue by creating partials. In JavaScript, we solve this by using something called modules!


## What are Modules?

Modules are an awesome way to chunk large blocks of code into smaller bite sized pieces that are stored in separate files. By breaking down our code this way, it becomes a lot easier to manage, as well as easier to understand.

Think back to when we were creating our API projects. We had one giant object that had lots of methods and properties stored on it. By the end of your project, I'm guessing it was starting to get pretty big. Now imagine we were accessing multiple different APIs, or had a few separate applications that we were all trying to store in one file. You can see how this could become unwieldy very quickly!

Thanks to modules, we can break this code up and manage each thing separately. Once we're done, all of the code gets wrapped up together for us (in a process called *bundling*) so that it can be used on our website.

## What do Modules look like?

There are a few different popular ways to implement modules. You've actually seen one before - take a look at this:

```javascript
// Load plugins
var gulp = require('gulp');
var sass = require('gulp-sass');
var autoprefixer = require('gulp-autoprefixer');

// Styles
gulp.task('styles', function() {
  ...
});
```

It's a gulpfile! In gulp, we bring in different modules (`sass`, `autoprefixer`, etc) so that we can use them on our code, whether it be to use sass or to minify our code. Even `gulp` itself is brought in as module so we can use it.

In our gulpfile, we use the `require` keyword to dive into our `node_modules` folder and grab modules we've installed from npm. We store this in a variable so that we can use it inside our code. This way we can have access to all the goodness that comes with gulp or any of the gulp plugins!

## Great! Let's use us some modules!

Not so fast.

Modules aren't natively supported by the browser. In the same way that you can't use partials unless you set up SASS, you can't take advantage of modules without a little bit of extra tooling and set up.

And unlike a lot of other ES6 features, even the bleeding edge browsers like Chrome Canary don't support modules yet. So we're going to rely on gulp and two packages called *browserify* and *babelify* to make sure our modules work in the browser.

Let's start by setting up our gulpfile.

## Setting up our gulpfile
Let's start by creating a new folder to store our project. We'll call it `learning-modules`. We'll also need to create sub-folders called `public`, to store our transpiled code, and `dev`, to store our working code.


From the `learning-modules` folder, type `npm init` and follow the prompts to generate your `package.json` file.

Now we'll need to install a few packages. Type:

`npm install gulp babelify browserify vinyl-source-stream vinyl-buffer babel-preset-env babel-core --save-dev`

Now create your `gulpfile.js`, and insert the following code:
```javascript
const gulp        = require('gulp');
const babelify    = require('babelify');
const browserify  = require('browserify');
const source      = require('vinyl-source-stream');
const buffer      = require('vinyl-buffer');

gulp.task('es6', () => {
  browserify('dev/app.js')
    .transform('babelify', {
      presets: ['env']
    })
    .bundle()
    .pipe(source('app.js'))
    .pipe(buffer())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('public/'));
});

gulp.task('default', ['es6'], () => {
  gulp.watch('dev/**/*.js', ['es6'])
});
```

Finally, we'll need to create an `app.js` file inside the `dev` folder - this will hold all the code for our project.

Now type `gulp`. If everything was set up successfully, our environment is ready to support modules and we can start making our first one!

## Building and Exporting Your Own Modules
Now that our build tools are set up, let's imagine that we're building a program that requires a lot of randomization - specifically, we need a function that will give us a random day of the week.

We're going to create a module named "Randomizer" to store this information. First, we need to create a file called `randomizer.js` - this is where we still store our module.

Let's start by just adding the code to `ranodmizer.js` as if this were any other JavaScript application:

```javascript
// randomizer.js

const days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

function getRandomDay() {
  const randomDay = Math.floor(Math.random() * days.length);

  return days[randomDay];
}
```

Awesome! But now we have to find a way to tell JavaScript that we want to be able to use this code in another file.

To do this, we can use the `export default` keywords.
```javascript
// randomizer.js

const days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

export default function getRandomDay() {
  const randomDay = Math.floor(Math.random() * days.length);

  return days[randomDay];
}
```

`export default` tells any files that want to import our `randomizer.js` module that we want them to have access to our `getRandomDay` function.

Note that you can only have ONE `export default` per module.

Awesome! Now our function is ready to be used inside of our main application.

## Importing your modules using 'import'

Let's hop over into `app.js` and imagine that we're beginning to write our application. We want to bring in our randomizer module so we can take advantage of the `getRandomDay` function we wrote.

Now that are functions have been made ready for use in our application with the `export` keyword, we need to bring them in using the `import` keyword!

```javascript
// app.js
import getRandomDay from './randomizer.js';

getRandomDay(); // Wednesday

```

And voila! We now have successfully imported our `getRandomDay` function.

Import allows us to dig into our `randomizer.js` module and pull out whatever was set as our default export (which, if you'll remember, was `getRandomDay`!).

Note: We could rename `getRandomDay` here to anything and it would still grab the function - it doesn't have to match the name of our function inside our module.  

## Importing and Exporting Named Functions

### Exporting Named Functions
Let's say we want to add another function to our module, that prints out a random number between one and one hundred:

```javascript
const days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

export default function getRandomDay() {
  const randomDay = Math.floor(Math.random() * days.length);

  return days[randomDay];
}

function getRandomNumber() {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
}
```

Since modules are only allowed to have one `export default`, how are we going to export our `getRandomNumber` function? Well, modules support something called `named exports` as well, like this:

```javascript
const days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday'];

export default function getRandomDay() {
  const randomDay = Math.floor(Math.random() * days.length);

  return days[randomDay];
}

export function getRandomNumber() {
  return Math.round(Math.random() * 100);
}
```

When we use the `export` function without the `default` keyword, this is called a `named export`.

### Importing Named Functions

Importing our named export is very similar to importing a default export. It looks like this:

```javascript
// app.js
import { getRandomNumber } from './randomizer.js';

randomNumber(); // Wednesday

```

We place the name of the function that we want to grab from the `randomizer` module inside the curly brackets. The curly bracket syntax might look similar to you if you remember our lesson on destructuring.

Now you know how to recognize and implement ES6 modules - we'll see them again when we start digging in to React!
