## API's

#### What's an API?

API stands for **"Application Programming Interface"**. This is a general term in computer programming, but when it comes to the web, it can stand for a couple things. We have already been using an API, jQuery for example has an API. It is how we interact with the large jQuery object. Commonly though an API is a means of accessing data from an external source.

Lots of popular websites provide APIs so that you can retrieve or send data inside your own website or app.

> A Twitter widget on your website connects to the twitter API to retrieve your three most recent tweets.

> A Facebook share/like button communicates with the Facebook API to post a new article share on your wall.

APIs are also a common method for providing data feeds, like weather forecasts, a movie catalogue, or the New York Times Best Sellers list.

Take a look at this crazy huge list of public APIs. <http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory/1?protocol=REST> 

#### RESTful APIs

To help make our lives as developers easier, many APIs conform to a set of standards called **REST** (which stands for "Representational State Transfer", if you were curious). We'll be working with RESTful APIs in this course.

When we work with a data API we use HTTP methods to tell the API what we want to do.

What does this mean for us?

**REST APIs use the same standards as ordinary web URLs.**

1. data lives at a URL eg. `http://api.cupcakes.com/flavours/` 
2. we can interact with data using the standard HTTP methods, **GET, POST, PUT,** and **DELETE** 

You might remember GET and POST from our work with forms.
 
**GET** requests data 
`http://api.cupcakes.com/flavours` gets a list of all available flavours

**POST** creates new data
`http://api.cupcakes.com/flavours/new` creates a new flavour, you would have to send new flavour information along with this request

**PUT** is used to update data, and **DELETE** is used to remove data, but you probably won't come across these that often.

Try viewing some of these GET examples in your browser.

#### Anatomy of a GET Request

The URLs we use to access data are referred to as **API endpoints**.

Additional options can be passed along with our request after the URL in the **query string**. 

These options are called **parameters**, and each parameter consists of a **key value** pair.

#### API keys and Authentication

Notice how some of our sample requests had strings of random letters and numbers in them?  

That's actually a unique passphrase, called an **API key**. It identifies us to the app, authorizing us for use. APIs use this or other forms of authentication (like OAuth or a username and password) to prevent spammy requests. 

You can often sign up for an API key for free. Let's try it with the Wunderground Weather API.

1. Visit [http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api)
2. Create a free account and Sign Up.
3. Click on "Pricing". 
4. The default options will work just fine. With a free developer account you can make up to 10 requests per minute and up to 500 requests per day. This will be plenty for our needs. Click on "Purchase Key".
5. Fill out the API form and upon completion you will see your Key ID.

#### JSON formatting

Let's take a closer look at some of the data we got back from our sample API calls.

```js
{
  "login": "HackerYou",
  "id": 2479724,
  "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2479724?",
  "gravatar_id": "adcc01adbba244c5eb41968040c6741e",
  "url": "https://api.github.com/users/HackerYou",
  "blog": "http://www.hackeryou.com",
  "location": "Toronto",
  "email": "info@hackeryou.com"
}
```

Curly braces, comma separated key value pairs. Looks a lot like a JavaScript object, right?  That's because it is!

This is a data format called **JavaScript Object Notation** or **JSON** for short.  

APIs can return data in many formats (you might also see XML), but we prefer to work with JSON because it's easy to work with in our JavaScript code. We'll see soon how to take data from and API and do things like output in into the DOM. 

Just like in JavaScript, you can include all kinds of data inside a JSON object, including strings, numbers, booleans, and nested arrays and objects. No functions though.

```js
{
   "vehicles":[
      {
         "source":"schedule",
         "type":"CLRV",
         "trip_id":96411,
         "lng":-79.392334,
         "distance":448.427203,
         "long_name":"504 King To Dundas West Station",
         "angle":192.025269,
         "velocity":16.096636,
         "short_name":"504",
         "lat":43.646019
      },
      {
         "source":"schedule",
         "type":"CLRV",
         "trip_id":97177,
         "lng":-79.390724,
         "distance":531.363251,
         "long_name":"504 King To Broadview Station",
         "angle":12.222412,
         "velocity":16.150303,
         "short_name":"504",
         "lat":43.64637
      }
   ],
   "lat":43.648716,
   "lng":-79.3964754
}
