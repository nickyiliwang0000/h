# Routing
In a broad sense, a _router_ directs a flow of information to a different place based on some criteria.

We're going to be using a package called _React Router_, which is one of many routers specific to React that will help us direct our information. Right now, all of our apps have only had one page to speak of (we'll call this a _view_), but what happens if we want to show a totally different view within the same application? React Router was written by some people who wanted to allow developers to direct their users between different views and prevent users from seeing things they shouldn't.

What this means for us is that React Router will hide and show components based on criteria we give it, and it will change the URL in the menu bar to reflect what a user would expect to see on a multi-page site while remaining a single page application.

## Building a personal website using React Router
In order to understand the basics of how React Router works, we're going to build a simple personal website with links to contact and about sections.

### Setting up React Router
Create a new React app using `create-react-app` and then install the `react-router-dom` package.

`npm install react-router-dom --save-dev`

Now that we've installed and configured `react-router`, let's set up our root `App` component.

`react-router-dom` is an npm module, so we can `import` it much in the same way that we import `react` and `react-dom`:

```javascript
import { 
BrowserRouter as Router, 
Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

You'll notice that our React Router import looks slightly different than our `React` and `ReactDOM` inputs. We have two curly brackets, followed by three comma separated names: `Router`, `Route`, and `Link`. 

Like `{Component}` that we have imported from `react`, `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, and `Link` are named exports from the React Router package. There are many other exports available to us, but we're only using these. This can help simplify our application and also decreases load time. 

You will notice `Router` is a bit special: we have this phrase `BrowserRouter as Router`. Remember that this is how we rename something that is exported from a module. The thing that is available for us to `import` is called `BrowserRouter` but we can change it to `Router` it using the `as` keyword.

Now let's create a few components so we can add routing to our application:

```javascript
//App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Route,
  Link
} from 'react-router-dom'


const Contact = (props) => {
    return(
      <h2>Contact</h2>
    )
}
const About = () =>{
    return(
      <h2> About me </h2>
    )
}

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <div>
          <h1>My Personal Webpage!</h1>
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
          <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        </div>
      </Router>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

Here we use our `App` component as the location for our router. The `App` component returns a `Router` component that wraps our HTML. (`Router` should only have one child, so wrap your content in a `div`or a `Fragment` if you need to.) Inside the `Router`, we can place `<Route />` components that will help us display specific content. When we go to a URL that matches the `path` attribute of a  `<Route />`,  our application will render the matched component!

#### Bonus: matching paths
`<Route />` has an attribute called `exact` which will match EXACTLY the path given. By default, matches are not exact, so a component whose path is `/` will render at the root as well as at `/about`, for example. 

If this becomes an issue, you can either be explicit about your paths or use a [`<Switch />`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch) and/or [`<Redirect />`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Redirect). Like `<Route />` and `<Router />`, you must import these chunks of code from React Router. We're not going to get into these here, but the linked resources may be helpful when you're building your React apps! ðŸ’ª

### Adding links
Since React Router is now controlling how we navigate within our app, we can make use of its special `<Link >` component, which allows the user to navigate between views. To access this component, we need to import it with the other named exports from React Router at the top of our page:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { 
  BrowserRouter as Router, 
  Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

And now we can use `<Link >` much the same way we use the `<a href="#" >` element:

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <div>
          <h1>My Personal Webpage!</h1>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
          <Route path="/about" component={About} />
          <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        </div>
      </Router>
    )
  }
}
```

With this, we can navigate between our components! Pretty amazing. You'll notice that we can use the browser's back and forward buttons and stay within our app.

### Nesting routes
A great thing about React Router is that we can create nested routes. Let's say we want to render some contact information for a specific member of our organization. In order to make this happen we need to modify our `Contact` component and include a `<Route />` to that contact information.

```javascript
const Contact =() =>{
    return(
    <div>
      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <Link to="/contact/michelle">Michelle</Link>
      <Route path="/contact/michelle" component={Michelle} />
    </div>        
    )
}

const About = () => {
     return(
         <h2>About me </h2>
     )
}

const Michelle = () =>{
      return (
      <p>Email: <a href="mailto:michelle@destinyschild.com">michelle@destinyschild.com</a></p>
    );
}

```

Now when we go to the contact page and click the `Michelle` link, we will see her info appear below her name!

#### Bonus: styling active links with React Router
By adding the `activeStyle` attribute to your `NavLink` component (which you've gotta import up at the top with `Link`) you can highlight whichever link is pointing to the current active route. Try adding the `activeStyle` attribute to your links like this:

```javascript
<NavLink to="/about" activeStyle={{ color: "red" }}>About</NavLink>
```
You can also add an active class name using the `activeClassName` attribute, like so:

```javascript
<NavLink to="/about" activeClassName="active">About</NavLink>
```

And then your CSS, you need to add a corresponding `.active` class. (The class does not need to be named `active` but the attribute in `NavLink` DOES need to be named `activeClassName`.)

```css
.active{
  background:orange;
}
```

### URL params
Sometimes it can be valuable to pass information from one route to another in order to provide some context as to how an upcoming view should be displayed. We can accomplish this using URL params.

Adding a route that accepts URL params isn't too complicated: we add `:paramName` to the end of our `<Route />` tag, like this:

`<Route path="/route/:paramName" component={ComponentName} />`

In your open file, change the route for the About page to include a `skill` parameter:

```javascript
//App.js
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <div>
          <h1>My Personal Webpage!</h1>
          <NavLink activeStyle={{ color: 'red' }} to ="/about">About</NavLink>
          <NavLink activeClassName="active" to ="/contact">Contact</NavLink>
          
          <Route path="/about/:skill" component={About} />

          <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
        </div>
      </Router>
    )
  }
}
```

Then, use this parameter somewhere in your `About` component:

```javascript

const About = (props) =>{
  return(
      <div>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an expert at {props.match.params.skill}!</p>
      </div>
  )
}
```
When you go to `localhost:3000/about/javascript`, you should see that you are an expert at JavaScript!

#### Bonus: another example
Let's say, for fun, we were building an apology generator that would generate a custom apology for a user based on their name:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { 
  BrowserRouter as Router, 
  Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const Apology = (props) =>{
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Dear {props.match.params.name},</h1>
        <p>I am so sorry that I watched the next episode of our show without consulting you. That was selfish of me.</p>
      </div>
    )
}

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Route path="/apology/:name" component={Apology} />
      </Router>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```

Now try navigating to `localhost:3000/apology/anyname` and see that the content will be customized based on what name you put in! This is kind of a silly example, but hopefully it gets you thinking about how params work and how information can be shared between views.

## Code-along: Movie catalogue
Now that we have a rough understanding of how params work, let's build an app that can catalogue and display movies so that we better understand when and how to use params.

## Bonus: conditionally rendering a component
Sometimes, you want a route to render a component with information from a parent state passed as props. `component` is not the only method that a route has. It also has `render`:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import { 
  BrowserRouter as Router, 
  Route } from 'react-router-dom';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(){
    super();
    this.state={
      topping:'mushrooms',
      sauce:'bianco'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Router>
        <Route path='/pizza' render={ () => { return (<Pizza topping={this.state.topping} sauce={this.state.sauce}/>)}} />
      </Router>
    )
  }
}
const Pizza = (props) =>{
  return(
    <p>I love pizza with {props.topping} and {props.sauce} sauce.</p>
  )
}
export default App;
```

We use an anonymous function to say "Hey, wait a second, I have some information for you!" and return a `Pizza` component with information from `App`'s state. The difference between this and using specific routing paths is that the component **is not rendered** in the React DOM at routes other than `/pizza`. In other cases we've seen, the components **are** rendered but not shown.
