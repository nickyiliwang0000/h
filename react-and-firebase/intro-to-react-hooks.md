# Intro to React Hooks

<<<<<<< HEAD
React Hooks are special functions that make it possible to "hook into" state and lifecycle methods in function components. React introduced Hooks in 2018 to solve some problems that the team had come up against while maintaining the React codebase for 5 years:

1. Classes can be difficult to understand (and take a lot of computer power to process).
2. `App.js` gets big and confusing with business logic that could be more reusable and componentized. 

Hooks eliminate the need for class components. (But Hooks are totally backwards compatiple and there are no plans to remove class components from the spec.) 

Because Hooks are functions, you can write your own!

> Imagine writing a handleClick function that manipulates the state in your `App.js` component. Instead of passing it down through the component tree, you can write a hook for it and import that hook into the components that need to manipulate that piece of statae.

## Using state in a function component
React Hooks includes a built-in Hook called `useState` that allows us to create and update state. `useState` is a function that accepts one argument: the starting value of the state we want to declare. The `useState` function returns an array of 2 items: 
1. the variable we are declaring
2. a function that we can use to update that specific piece of state 

To use `useState`, we have to import `useState` from the React library.

React Hooks make it possible to use state and lifecycle methods in Function components therefore eliminating the need for Class components. But don't worry there is no plans to remove Class components from the spec.

They also make it possible to reuse stateful logic by making our own hooks.

## Using State in a Function Component

React Hooks includes a built-in Hook called `useState` that allows us to create and update state. `useState` is a function that accepts one parameter which sets the starting value of the state we want to declare. It returns an array of 2 items - the first is the variable we are declaring and the second is a function that we can use to update that specific piece of state. 

Let's look at it once and then break down the pieces.

First, we have to import `useState` from the react library.
>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
We can name the two values returned from the `useState` function with array destructuring:
=======
Using array destructuring, we can name those two returned items for use in our code. 

>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8
```jsx
const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Here, we are creating a variable to hold the return value of useState, which is an array of 2 items. We are naming the first item `likes`, which will be the name of the piece of state we want to access.

The second value in the destructed array names the function that we will use to update the `likes` value in state. In this case we have named it `setLikes`. This function will replace the use of `this.setState()`. When we call `setLikes`, we will pass in the new value of the `likes` state as an argument.

The `0` value in `useState(0)` sets the initial state of `likes` to 0. This is the same as doing:

```jsx
this.state({
    likes: 0,
})
```

## Refactoring a class component to a function component using Hooks

Consider this class component:
=======
## Updating a Class component to a Function Component

When we define state in a Class component we do it like this:

>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8
```jsx
class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount(){
    super();
    this.state = {
        likes: 0
    }
  }
  addLike = () =>{
      this.setState({
          likes: this.state.likes + 1
      })
  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
            Likes: {this.state.like}
            <button onClick={this.addLike}>‚ô•Ô∏è</button>
        </div>
    ) 
  }
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
Using Hooks, that same component looks like this:
=======
Now we can change it to look like this:

>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8
```jsx
function App() {
    const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            Likes: {likes}
            <button onClick={() => setLikes(likes + 1)}>‚ô•Ô∏è</button>
        </div>
    ) 
  }
}
```

### Calling useState() multiple times

We can call `useState()` as many times as we like within our components for different pieces of state.

```jsx
const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState('Guest');
const [musicList, setMusicList] = useState(['The Beatles', 'War on Drugs', 'Florence and the Machine']);
```

Now our state object has three keys on it - 'likes', 'currentUser', and 'musicList'. You could visualize it like this: 

```jsx
this.state = {
    likes: 0,
    currentUser: 'Guest',
    musicList: ['The Beatles', 'War on Drugs', 'Florence and the Machine']
}
```

## Using lifecycle methods in a function component
React Hooks includes a built-in Hook called `useEffect` that allows us to hook into a component's lifecycle methods.

`useEffect` is like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` combined. It is called after the first render and after every update. 

We load it in from React the same way we load in `useState`:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
`useEffect` accepts [a callback function](https://github.com/HackerYou/bootcamp-notes/blob/master/applied-javascript/how-do-callbacks-work.md) as an argument. 
=======
Then we can start to use it within our Function component. `useEffect` accepts a callback function as parameter that contains the code that we want to execute after every render. 
>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8

```jsx
function App(){
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log('hello');
    })
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
We probably want to do something more interesting than `console.log`. `useEffect` seems like a great place to make API calls, connect to Firebase, or subscribe to some external information.

>>>>>>> e3adf998bb4e184900f250b34ff6ad601bc1c8f8
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
    const dbRef = firebase.database().ref();
        dbRef.on('value', (snapshot) => {
            const database = snapshot.val();
            setMessages(database)
        })
    })
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
And it is! But there was a reason that we made these API calls in `componentDidMount` rather than in `componentDidUpdate`. The `componentDidMount` method usually only runs once. If we try to refactor an API call in `componentDidMount` to look like the code above, we will run into an infinite loop error because we are **setting the state after every render** which is causing the component to rerender... which is causing the component to rerender... which is causing the component to rerender...

<!-- IMAGE OF THE ERROR MESSAGE -->
![Infinite loop error message](https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/infinite-loop-screenshot--bootcamp.png)

To remedy this, we can pass an empty array as the second argument to `useEffect`. This argument is a list of properties that the `useEffect` function will compare against current state and props to check if it should run the callback we passed to it. 
Passing an empty array means it will never have to rerun because it has nothing to check against.

To remedy this, we can add an empty array as the second argument to `useEffect`. This argument is a list of properties which the useEffect function will compare against current state and props to check if it should call the effect. If we pass it an empty array, then it knows it will never have to rerun because it has no dependancies.

    const dbRef = firebase.database().ref();

            setMessages(database)
        })
    }, [])
```

### Calling useEffect() multiple times

<<<<<<< HEAD
Just like `useState`, we can call `useEffect` multiple times within a component. This allows us to separate different code functionality into different instances of `useEffect` which makes our code more modular. When React runs the code, it keeps track of the order in which each `useEffect` is called. For this reason, we can't call `useEffect` from inside a conditional. Instead, we will conditionally run code inside of useEffect.
