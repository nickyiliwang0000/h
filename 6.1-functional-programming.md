Transforming Data
### Working with Data

When working with data, we often need to tweak and bend the data to our needs. Not every array is exactly what we need for every purpose. Especially in the case of returned data from external API's, we need to adapt the data to what our project requires.

Luckily there are useful native JavaScript methods, and powerful external libraries that exist to help us accomplish these tasks. While these problems could be solved by some creative iteration and reworking of arrays using methods, we can utilize these tools today.

#### Native Methods

In 2009, ECMAScript 5 was introduced and the following methods were included among others, to help sort data. The three methods in the next section are all methods to iterate over an array or object, but they differ in terms of functionality. 

With each method below, a callback function is used to define the task to be performed on the data. 

#### Functional Programming

The methods and libraries we will be looking at are part of a programming paradigm called Functional Programming. Although it sounds fancy and might make you think of math, think of functional programming as a way to take data and, using functions, transform it anyway you want.

Check out these <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84" target="_blank">great videos</a> on youtube for more information about functional programming!

For more information on the iteration methods available within native JS, read and check out [this article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Iteration_methods) on MDN. Be aware that the methods below work in IE9+, and some newer methods may not work in anything, **but** modern browsers.

## Immutability

Immutable data structures are any data structure that can't be modified - once it's created it just sits, it just is, and never changes. Directly mutating data structures can prevent us from gaining access to the original state of our data if we needed to in the future.

We can achieve immutability through pure functions, aka functions that will always return a given value if provided with the same input values. They don't have any unwanted side effects, such as changing anything in the global scope (outside of the function). `map()`, `filter()` and `reduce()` methods are considered pure functions.

Here is an example of pure and impure functions.

### Impure Function
```javascript
//Impure
let total = 0;

function add(a,b) {
	total = a + b;
}
add(2,3);
console.log(total);
```
### Pure Function
```javascript
//pure

function add(a,b) {
	return a + b;
}
const total = add(2,3);
```

## Mutable versus Immutability

Here are examples using .splice() and .slice() to illustrate the difference between mutable and immutable data.

### Mutable: 
```javascript
const zoo = ['giraffe', 'monkey', 'lion', 'panda', 'hippo']
zoo.splice(2, 1)  // remove 1 item at 2-index position (that is 'lion')

//zoo contains ['giraffe', 'monkey', 'panda', 'hippo']
```

In the above example, we no longer have access to our original zoo array, only the modified version.

### Immutable: 

```javascript
const zoo = ['giraffe', 'monkey', 'lion', 'panda', 'hippo'];
const newZoo = zoo.slice(1, 3)

//zoo contains ['giraffe', 'monkey', 'lion', 'panda', 'hippo']
//newZoo contains ['monkey', 'lion']
```
Here, we have access to both the original zoo array AND our new version.

We'll be going over a few super useful methods and you can <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/functionalProgramming.html" download>follow along with this file</a>

### .map()
The `.map()` method allows us to 'map' over an existing array, provide a callback function to be run, that transforms the data and returns it.

The `.map()` method **returns** a new array, so it's ideal to create a variable to hold the result.

#### Examples

**Dividing values in an array**

```js
const numbers = [10, 100, 25, 20];

const halfNumbers = numbers.map(function(value) {
    return value / 2;
});

console.log(halfNumbers);
//[5, 50, 12.5, 10];
```

The `.map()` method will run a function for every element in the array, and it will allow you to make any changes you need to the data.


**Creating an array of items from objects**

```js
const persons = [
  {first: 'Taylor', last: 'Swift'},
  {first: 'Ash', last: 'Ketchum'},
  {first: 'Hermione', last: 'Granger'}
];

const people = persons.map((value) =>  {
    return value.first + ' ' + value.last;
});

console.log(people);
//["Taylor Swift", "Ash Ketchum", "Hermione Granger"]

```

### .filter()
Where the `.map()` method returns a new array of all the elements, the `.filter()` method returns all items that meet a condition you provided inside of your callback function. 

Again, this method returns a new array, but only for the values that are returned `true` from your condition.

### Examples

**Filtering out members that are younger than 19**

```js

const users = [
  { name: 'Spider-Man', age: 16 },
  { name: 'Charlie Kelly', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Gandalf the Grey', age: 90 },
  { name: 'Prudence Thunder', age: 9 }
];

const ofAge = users.filter((value) => {
    return value.age >= 19
});

console.log(ofAge);
//[
//  { name: 'Charlie Kelly', age: 25 },
//  { name: 'Gandalf the Grey', age: 90 }
//];

```

**Filter Titles longer than 8 characters**

```js
const posts = ["Pain", "Sweetness", "Work", "The Middle", "I will steal you back"];

const longTitles = posts.filter((value) => {
    return value.length >= 8;
});

// longTitles = ["Sweetness", "The Middle", "I will steal you back"]

```

### .forEach()

The `.forEach()` method is a familiar face. It simply iterates over an array, and performs a provided task. Within the callback, we can define two arguments that represent the iterated item, the _value_ and the _index_. It does not return a new array, it simply lets your perform some task.

It is much like the `.each()` method in jQuery in that it can perform the requested task, but does not return a new array.


#### Example
Let's say we wanted to display a list of movie genres to our movie catalogue website. We have a div that looks like this:

```html
<div class='movieGenres'>
</div>
```

We can use a forEach to append each movie genre to the `movieGenres` container one at a time:

```javascript
const genres = ["Horror", "Comedy", "Drama", "Action", "Suspense", "Documentary"];

genres.forEach((genre) =>  {
    $('.movieGenres').append('<p>' + genre + '</p>');
});
```
### .reduce()

The reduce method will iterate over an array and accepts two parameters, the total value (accumulator) and the current amount (current value). 

#### Example
Here is a simple example of an array of numbers that need to be added up.

```javascript
const nums = [2, 4, 6, 8]
const sum = nums.reduce((total, amount) => {
	return total + amount
});
//sum is 20
```

Similarly to a map, filter, and forEach, as the reduce method cycles through the array (like a for-loop), it  contains a callback function, which in this case gets executed against an 'accumulator' and each element in the array (from left or right) to reduce it to a single value.

#### Example
Here is another useful example of when we can use .reduce() to 'flatten' multiple arrays into one single array.

```javascript
const nums = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]];
const flat = nums.reduce((total, amount) => {
  return total.concat(amount);
});

flatten array // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

## Underscore JS

For further control, a library called [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) exists. Much like jQuery, Underscore.js provides helpful shortcuts and tools, specifically for working with data.

Underscore.js is organized into methods for working with [collections of data](http://underscorejs.org/#collections), [arrays](http://underscorejs.org/#arrays), [objects](http://underscorejs.org/#objects) and [functions](http://underscorejs.org/#functions). To use the library, include a link to the library in your HTML, ideally from a [CDN](http://cdnjs.com/libraries/underscore.js/) and before your scripts.

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.8.3/underscore-min.js"></script>
```

All the methods are part of an object named `_`. Similar to how everything from jQuery is on the `$` object. Whenever we call a method, we call `_.find()` and pass in arguments. With all methods, it's possible to pass in a callback function that handles the resulting task.

### _.find()

The `_.find()` method iterates over a list and returns the first value that passes a test. If no result is found, it returns `undefined`, otherwise it continues until the first result is found.

#### Example

**Find the first value that starts with "E"**

```js
const users = ["Kristen", "Drew", "Ryan", "Christopher", "Eunice", "Eva", "Heather"];

const firstName = _.find(users, function(value) {
  return value.charAt(0) === "E"
});

console.log(firstName)
//"Eunice"

```

### _.where()

The `_.where()` method iterates over each value in a list, and returns an array of all the values that match the provided argument to search for. The argument provided is an object that will be used as the search guidelines.

#### Examples

**Sort data by year**

```js
const data = [ 
    { firstName: 'Drew', year: 1984 },
    { firstName: 'Ryan', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Kristen', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Eunice', year: 1987}
];

const eightyFour = _.where(data, {year: 1984});
const eightyFive = _.where(data, {year: 1985});
```

### _.pluck()

Much like the native `.map()` method, `_.pluck()` allows the creation of a new array by searching for a single property name and returning a new array. This is useful when you want to have an array with only specific information while retaining the original collection.

_*If you need to provide multiple properties, the map method is your best bet*_

#### Example

**Creating a new array with only the names of each object**

```js
const data = [ 
    { firstName: 'Drew', year: 1984 },
    { firstName: 'Ryan', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Kristen', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Ryan', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Eunice', year: 1987}
];

const names = _.pluck(data, 'firstName');
```

### _.uniq()

The `_.uniq()` method is useful in that it helps to remove duplicates within an array. By simply passing an array, it will sort and remove all duplicates, or a function can be passed that defines what duplicates to search for.

### Examples

**Removing duplicate names**

```js
const users = ["drew", "ryan", "kristen", "drew", "kristen", "eva", "drew"];

const clean = _.uniq(users);

console.log(clean);
//["drew", "ryan", "kristen", "eva"]
```

**Removing Objects that appear twice**

```js
const data = [ 
    { firstName: 'Drew', year: 1984 },
    { firstName: 'Ryan', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Kristen', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Drew', year: 1984 },
    { firstName: 'Ryan', year: 1985 },
    { firstName: 'Eunice', year: 1987}
];

const cleaned = _.uniq(data, function(value) {
    return value.firstName;
});

```

### _.first(), _.last(), _.initial() and _.rest()

These four methods return either the first or last values in an array, or a number of items in the beginning or the end.

For the next few examples, the following example array will be used.

```js
const data = [100, "Dog", true, 14, undefined];
```

#### _.first()
Returns the first element of an array, or passing an argument will return the first X number of items from the array.

```js
const firstTwo = _.first(data, 2);

// firstTwo = [100, "Dog"]
```

#### _.last()
Returns the last element of an array, or passing an argument will return the last X number of items from the end of the array

```js
const lastThree = _.last(data, 3);

// lastThree = [true, 14, undefined];
```


#### _.initial()
Returns everything but the last entry of the array.  Passing an argument will exclude the last X elements from the result.

```js
const firstNums = _.initial(data);
// firstNums = [100, "Dog", true, 14]

let allButTheLastTwo = _.initial(data, 2);
// allButTheLastTwo = [100, "Dog", true]
```

#### _.rest()
Returns everything but the first entry of an array. Passing an argument will return items from that index number forward

```js
const allButFirst = _.rest(data);
// allButFirst = ["Dog", true, 14, undefined]

const fourthOnward = _.rest(data, 3);
// fourthOnward = [14, undefined]
```

## Moving forward 

Again, all of the above tools are part of a programming paradigm called 'Functional Programming'. This concept is the idea that a developer should have the proper tools (functions) on hand to accomplish a task.
