Spread Operator

Some times you want to do something with an array that we can't! For example let's assume we have an array of numbers that we want to find the max of.

```js
let numbers = [39,25,90,123];
let max = Math.max(numbers);
console.log(max); // NaN
```

`Math.max` is a method that accepts a comma separated list of values and will return the max! Sadly we can not pass an array to it. There is a way to get around this, we can use a method called `.apply` that will take an array and call a function as if we had passed them in as a list.

```js
let numbers = [39,25,90,123];
let max = Math.max.apply(null,numbers);
console.log(max); // 123
```

This could be a little confusing, what if there was an easier way to do this? In ES6 there is a the spread operator! The syntax looks like this `...numbers`, what this does is spread out the elements from the array! So we can change the above `.apply` call to look like this.

```js
let numbers = [39,25,90,123];
let max = Math.max(...numbers);
console.log(max); // 123
```

#### Using spread to concat

You can use the spread operator to also concatenate arrays together!

```js
let numbersArray1 = [3,4,5,7,8];
let numbersArray2 = [9,6,10,11];
let concatArray = [...numbersArray1,...numbersArray2];
console.log(concatArray); // [3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 6, 10, 11]
```
