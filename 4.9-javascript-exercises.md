Time to combine all the fundamentals we’ve used so far and used them together to built a small JavaScript program.

Remember to break down your program into small steps that a computer can understand. Write out some pseudocode first and refer to the <a href="https://notes.hackeryou.com/lesson/569964386fcff4ed4fd521b1/56981343fd2768a62f6e3df4">JavaScript Cheat Sheet</a> to help you with the syntax as you translate pseudocode into JavaScript.

## Coin Flip and More
We’ll build a JavaScript coin flipping machine! Open up  <a href="https://hychalknotes.s3.amazonaws.com/js-fundamentals-exercise.html" download>Fundamentals Exercise</a> to get started.

## Create a 'mad libs' game. (By Garrett Levine)
#### Step 1
prompt the user for 3 seperate words.
- A noun.
- An adjective.
- An adverb.
using these choices, `console.log` a mad lib where the prompts replace the blanks...
"After they did that, the king played chess on his brother's
__________(noun) and then combed his __________ (adjective)
hair with a comb made out of old fish bones.
Later, that same day, I saw the Monkey King dance __________
(adverb) in front of an audience of kangaroos and wombats."
#### Step 2
instead of generating a set mad lib, pick a random one between two options and console log the result.
you'll need to...
-get a random number between 1 and 2 (look back at using `Math` in javascript)
-`console.log` a different madlib if that number is 1, or if that number is 2
"The day I saw the Monkey King
__________(adverb) sing. It was one of the most
__________(adjective) days of the year.
Everyone brought their _________(noun) and was havin a great time!"
