## Organizing Files

### Organizing Files

As a developer, you will be required to manage many projects, and within those projects, there will be many files and folders. Maintaining an organized file system will help to ensure that project assets are kept together and are easy to access what is needed.

#### Spaces in naming

Now that you're a developer, you're going to take the spaces out of your folder names. Spaces can cause a bunch of frustrating issues down the line, so get into the habit of removing spaces in your folder and files names now.

**BAD**
```bash
- project one
	- home page.html
-project two
	- about page.html
```

**GOOD**
```bash
- projectOne
	- index.html
-projectTwo
	- about.html
```

Without spaces, how can we read the actual names of the files? Here are a few common patterns:

**Camel Case**
Camel case is a pattern where spaces are removed from blocks of text and each word but the first starts with a capital letter.

`a cool file name.html` becomes `aCoolFileName.html`.

A folder named 'about page' becomes a folder named `aboutPage`.

This can also be applied to our code as we will see in the lessons.

**Kebab Case or Underscores**
The method of using hyphens or underscores to separate words.

`a cool file name.html` can become `a-cool-file-name.html` or `a_cool_file_name.html`.

A folder named `about page` becomes a folder named `about-page` or `about_page`.

It really doesn't matter what you use as long as you are CONSISTENT.


#### Projects
Working with files all over your computer can get messy fast, especially because you'll have multiple files named `index.html` and folders named `styles` or `scripts`. There should only be one `index.html` within each folder.

Often, developers create a `sites` or `websites` folder at root of the computer that contains folders for categories of projects. These project folders may include a numbering system that represents project IDs or dates.

Putting the folder at the root of your computer will allow for easy access of projects when you use tools like [the command line](https://notes.hackeryou.com/lesson/588663d3d2f16a4a535b4445/5ac38e019f86d2f20b0e6474).

On a Mac, you can access your root directory by opening a new Finder window and clicking your username in the sidebar. You may have a sites folder already present, but if not, right-click and create a new folder called `Sites`.

On Windows, open up Windows Explorer to `My Documents` and create a `Sites` folder.

**Create a folder for HackerYou projects**
During your time at HackerYou, you will be given many exercises and will create many exercises.

Within your `Sites` folder, create a new folder called `hackeryou`. Within that new folder, create a folder for each week of the bootcamp.

```bash
- Sites
    - hackeryou
        - week1
        - week2
        - week3
        - week4
        - week5
        - week6
        - week7
        - week8
        - week9
```

When working on a project, we recommend that you open the project directly within your text editor. This allows you to work without being confused about which file belongs to which project.

Also, **close your files when you are not working on them**. Practice tab minimalism.
