JavaScript Arrays

## Arrays

Imagine that you wanted to make a list of values where the **order mattered**. You could use and object and do this:

```js
const musicObject = {
	"0": "do",
	"1": "re",
	"2": "mi",
	"3": "fa",
	"4": "sol",
	"5": "la",
	"6": "ti",
	"7": "do"
}
```

Using an object we could set the keys of the properties to be numbers, this way we enforce some order. If you remember, there is no guarantee that an object will return the same order when iterated over. Thankfully JavaScript has a built-in object called **"Array"** that does what we want. An array looks like this:

```js
const musicObject = [
	"do",
	"re",
	"mi",
	"fa",
	"sol",
	"la",
	"ti",
	"do"
]
```

or to save space:

```js
const musicObject = [ "do", "re", "mi", "fa", "sol", "la", "ti", "do" ]
```

An important thing to note is that an array is just an object in JavaScript, but it has some extra features for us to use. 

What are the differences between a regular object and an array object in terms of syntax?

**Note**: 

* The first number in a sequence is usually 1 but not in programming. Javascript (and many other programming languages) are zero-based meaning the first property of the array has an **index** (property name) of 0. Meaning `musicObject.0` will not work, `musicObject[0]` however will work. 
* We can't use dot-notation to get at the values so we use bracket-notation to get the values. 
* Any values (objects, numbers, string, other arrays..) can be inside of arrays.

**Exercises**:

The following exercises use this array object:

`const theArray = ["Homer likes pie", 34, { name: "First", age: 66 } ]`

1. Retrieve the 2nd value in the array.s
2. Update the first value to `"Homer likes beer"`
3. Retrieve the age property of the object in the array.
4. Update the name property of the object in the array to `"Jack"`.

Note the chaining of expressions. `theArray[2]` returns us an object which we can immediately work with. Since the value is an object literal, we can use dot-notation `theArray[2].age`. We don't need to store the value in a variable and then get its properties. Can you think of how you could use bracket notation to retrieve the age?
